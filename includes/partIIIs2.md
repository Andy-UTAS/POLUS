Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your third-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at complex phenomenon and build your ability to employ the scientific method.

Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook, with a hurdle requirement being that you provide a brief presentation for each experiment.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](../), including the [available experiments](#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](../reference/experiment/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

Labs are co-ordinated by Andy McCulloch, and all enquiries should be directed to the [physics lab mailbox](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au).

## Summary

You must complete *two experiments* for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and has a hurdle requirement of an informal presentation. Additionally, you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from any time in the year; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation.

## Schedule

Labs will run in three _blocks_ of labs, each lasting for three weeks. The dates for semester two, 2022 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 3, 4, and 5 (August 5th - August 25th), with logbooks to be submitted to the block one dropbox by the end of Sunday, August 25th
* Experiment block two: weeks 6, 7, and 8 (August 26th - September 22nd), with logbooks to be submitted to the block two dropbox by the end of Sunday, September 22nd

During each block, whiteboard presentations are to be undertaken during the common lab session (Monday, 1400 - 1700 in the part III lab) in second week of the block, or explicitly:

* Experiment block one: Monday August 12th
* Experiment block two: Monday September 9th

A final _block_ is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 10: report preparation. Submission for peer assessment using the embedded FeedbackFruits app on MyLO by the end of Friday, October 4th
* Week 11: Peer assessment. Feedback due for submission by the end of Friday, October 11th
* Week 12: Editing. Your final report is to be submitted to the dropbox by the end of Friday, October 18th
* Week 13: Lab report presentations. Presentations are to take place in the final common session, on Monday, October 21st

The weighting of assessments for this semester is as follows:

* Experiment one (30%)
* Experiment two (30%)
* Scientific communication: report (20%), presentation (10%), and peer assessment (10%)
