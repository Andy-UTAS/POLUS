Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your second-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at physical phenomena and hone your ability to employ the scientific method.

Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/), including the [available experiments](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/reference/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

The part II labs are co-ordinated by the subject coordinator, and all enquiries should be directed to the [physics lab mailbox](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au)

## Overview

Working in pairs, you will complete **three experiments** for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from the semester; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation.

## Schedule

Labs will run in three two blocks of 3 weeks. The dates for semester one, 2023 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 2, 3, and 4, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment
* Experiment block two: weeks 5, 6, and 7, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment
* Experiment block three: weeks 8, 9, and 10, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment

A final _block_ is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 11: report preparation, with submission for peer assessment by the end of Friday, September 29th
* Week 12: Peer assessment and editing, with peer assessment feedback due by the end of Wednesday, October 4th, and submission of your final report by the end of Sunday, October 8th
* Week 13: Lab report presentations, Monday October 9th and Wednesday October 11th
Assessment

Assessment will primarily be performed through the development and submission of logbooks, which you will build over the course of each 3-week experiment to detail your methodology, results, discussion and general thoughts.   In addition to the material on the website, you can discuss how to approach writing and structuring your experimental logbook with your demonstrator.

Combined with the final session presentation, weighting for assessments are:

* Experiment one (25%)
* Experiment two (25%)
* Experiment three (25%)
* Scientific communication: report (15%), presentation (5%), and peer assessment (5%)
