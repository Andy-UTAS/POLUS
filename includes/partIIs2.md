Experiments are a cornerstone of scientific understanding. During your second-year studies, your experimental laboratories will be geared towards enabling an independent exploration of physical phenomena and developing your skills and confidence in experimental analysis.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/), including the [available experiments](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/reference/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

## Overview

Working in pairs, you will complete **three experiments** for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from the semester; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation.

## Schedule

Labs will run in **three blocks of 3 weeks**. The dates for semester two, 2024 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 2, 3, and 4, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment
* Experiment block two: weeks 5, 6, and 7, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment
* Experiment block three: weeks 8, 9, and 10, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment

A **final _block_** is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 11: report preparation, with submission for peer assessment by the end of Friday.
* Week 12: Peer assessment and editing, with peer assessment feedback due by the end of Wednesday and submission of your final report by the end of Sunday.
* Week 13: Lab report presentations.

## Assessment

Assessment will primarily be performed through the development and submission of <u>**logbooks**<\u>, which you will build over the course of each 3-week experiment to detail your methodology, results, discussion and general thoughts. In addition to the material on the website, you can discuss how to approach writing and structuring your experimental logbook with your demonstrator.

Combined with the final session presentation, weighting for assessments are:

* Experiment one (25%)
* Experiment two (25%)
* Experiment three (25%)
* Scientific communication: report (15%), presentation (5%), and peer assessment (5%)
