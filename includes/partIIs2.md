Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your second-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at physical phenomena and hone your ability to employ the scientific method.

Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/), including the [available experiments](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/reference/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

The part II labs are co-ordinated by the subject coordinator, and all enquiries should be directed to the [physics lab mailbox](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au)

## Summary

You must complete three experiments for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from the semester; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation.

## Schedule

Labs will run in three _blocks_ of labs, each lasting for three weeks. The dates for semester two, 2022 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 2, 3, and 4 (July 18th - August 5th), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox (Monday and Wednesday) by 1300 on the day following your experiment
* Experiment block two: weeks 5, 6, and 7 (August 8th - August 26th), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox (Monday and Wednesday) by 1300 on the day following your experiment
* Experiment block three: weeks 8, 9, and 10 (September 5th - September 23rd),
with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox (Monday and Wednesday) by 1300 on the day following your experiment

A final block is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 11: report preparation, submission for peer assessment by the end of Friday, September 30th
* Week 12: Peer assessment and editing, peer assessment feedback due by the end of Tuesday, October 4th, and final report submission by the end of Friday, October 7th
* Week 13: Lab report presentations, Monday October 10th and Wednesday October 12th
Assessment

## Assessment

The weighting of assessments for this semester is as follows:

* Experiment one (25%)
* Experiment two (25%)
* Experiment three (25%)
* Scientific communication: report (15%), presentation (5%), and peer assessment (5%)

As soon as possible, you should:

Sign-up to a laboratory session. Labs are run weekly, between 1300 - 1600 on Mondays and 1400 - 1700 on Thursdays. To confirm your attendance to a lab session, please enrol into in lab group here.
Complete the Laboratory and Workshop Inductions 2022 module. In order to access a lab or workshop at UTAS, you must complete the Green-level induction within the Laboratory and Workshop Inductions 2022 module on MyLO. If this link shows 'not authorised', please go to MyLO home page (where all your units are listed) and use the Discover Course Catalogue tab on the top right of page. You should be able to search for, and enrol into the Laboratory and Workshop Induction 2022 unit.

Upload the certificate. Following successful completion of the induction, you will be emailed a completion certificate (within 24 hours) which must be uploaded here.

Note: if you have completed this induction for another subject in 2022, you can upload the same completion certificate.

These tasks must be completed by the end of Friday July 16th
