Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your second-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at physical phenomena and hone your ability to employ the scientific method.

Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/), including the [available experiments](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/reference/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

The part II labs are co-ordinated by the subject coordinator, and all enquiries should be directed to the [physics lab mailbox](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au).

## Summary

You must complete **two experiments** for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must deliver an informal presentation based on an experiment of your choice from the semester.

## Schedule

Lab sessions are scheduled at the following times, with the following demonstrators:

|  Laboratory Sessions  |  Demonstrators  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  Wednesdays 1000 - 1300  |  Andy & Simin  |
|  Fridays 1200 - 1500  |  Ian & Earl  |

If you have clashes with the above sessions, please contact the&nbsp;Lab Coordinator.&nbsp;

An introductory lab session will be held in week 6 (March 27th - April 2nd) will provide detailed practical information for the lab program, including lab safety, labs practicalities, experimental technique - including logbook preparation - and more.

Labs will run in two _blocks_ of labs, each lasting for three weeks. The dates for semester one, 2023 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 7, 8, and 9 (April 3rd - April 30th), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by 1700 on the day following your experiment
* Experiment block two: weeks 10, 11, and 12 (May 1st - May 21st), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by 1700 on the day following your experiment

A final session is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 13: Informal whiteboard presentations, Wednesday May 24th and Friday May 26th
Assessment

## Assessment

The weighting of assessments for this semester is as follows:

* Experiment one (45%)
* Experiment two (45%)
* Scientific communication: presentation (10%)
