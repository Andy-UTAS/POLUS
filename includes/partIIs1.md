Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your second-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at physical phenomena and hone your ability to employ the scientific method.

Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook.

All information for the lab program is hosted on the [lab website](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/), including the [available experiments](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/partII/#experiments) (and associated documentation), [reference material](https://polus.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/reference/) for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

The part II labs are co-ordinated by the unit coordinator, and all enquiries should be directed to the [physics lab mailbox](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au).

## Summary

Working in pairs, you will complete **two experiments** for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must deliver an informal presentation based on an experiment of your choice from the semester.

## Schedule

Lab sessions are scheduled at the following times, with the following demonstrators:

|  Laboratory Sessions  |  Demonstrators  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  Tuesdays 0900 - 1200  |  Danijela & Natalia  |
|  Wednesdays 1100 - 1400  |  Georgia & Sam  |

If you have clashes with the above sessions, please contact the Lab Coordinator.

An introductory lab session will be held in week 6 (April 8th - April 14th) will provide detailed practical information for the lab program, including lab safety, labs practicalities, experimental technique - including logbook preparation - and more. ^^Attendance to this introductory session is compulsory^^.

Labs will run in two _blocks_ of three weeks, each lasting for three weeks, with each block assigned to complete one experiment The dates for semester one, 2023 are as follows:

* Experiment block one: weeks 7, 8, and 9 (April 15th - May 5th), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by 1700 on the day following your experiment
* Experiment block two: weeks 10, 11, and 12 (May 6st - May 26th), with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by 1700 on the day following your experiment

A final session is to be dedicated to scientific communication:

* Week 13: Informal whiteboard presentations, Wednesday May 24th and Friday May 26th

## Assessment

Assessment will primarily be performed through the development and submission of **logbooks**, which you will build over the course of each 3-week experiment to detail your methodology, results, discussion and general thoughts. In addition to the material on the website, you can discuss how to approach writing and structuring your experimental logbook with your demonstrator.

The weighting of assessments for this semester is as follows:

* Lab safety & introduction (10%)
* Experiment one logbook (40%)
* Experiment two logbook (40%)
* Scientific communication: presentation (10%)
