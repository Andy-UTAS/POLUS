Now this is not to say that nothing was known about the systems, on the contrary: empirical laws had been used to great effect to describe the observable world, but with the increasing sophistication of experimental technique and apparatus, the cracks in certain rules started to appear. Expected competencies It is assumed that you have familiarity with the following concepts/techniques: Thermal physics: heat capacity Quantum mechanics: energy spectrum of the harmonic oscillator Statistical physics: the partition function, equipartition theorem The Dulong\u2013Petit law \u00b6 Consider the heat capacity of a solid. Explain the concept of heat capacity to someone without a science background. Said someone can be imaginary if required The heat capacity is the a measure of how much heat, or how much energy transfer, is required to change the temperature of a material. By measuring the heat capacity per weight, that is the mass-specific heat capacity , of a range of different elements, the two chemists Pierre Dulong and Alexis Petit observed the value was approximately constant when multiplied by the atomic weight of the element, stating that: c \\times M = constant where c is the specific heat capacity and M is the molar mass of the material. More commonly, one will see the law expressed in terms of the heat capacity C and number of moles n : C/n=\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T} = 3R where R \\approx 8.314~\\mathrm{J K^{-1} mol^{-1}} is the ideal gas constant 1 . In the physics context, it is much more common do talk about the number of atoms N , which transforms the above equation into the Dulong-Peteit Law : C/N= 3 k_\\mathrm{B} But is this an accurate description? Let's have a look. Shown below is a plot of the heat capacity C 2 (in units of R ) as a function of atomic number: Heat capacity of the elements at room temperature as sourced from the CRC handbook of chemistry of physics which is pretty incredible. But a natural question arises: why is this the case? The Boltzmann model of a solid \u00b6 It was exactly the question of \"why does the Dulong-Petit law seem to work?\" that motivated Ludwig Boltzmann to use his novel - and at the time completely unaccepted - ideas, notably the existence of atoms and molecules and the mechanics that arises from statistically significant numbers of these atoms and molecules, to model unexplained systems. The insight of Boltzmann was to consider a solid as a collection of constituent particles, but unlike gasses, these particles would be strongly interacting. Explicitly, the idea of atoms interacting with their nearest neighbours through an elastic spring-like potential - an harmonic potential - would allow the system to be modelled with statistical mechanics. Like the case of a gas, energy can be stored in the system in the form of atomic motion, but unlike a gas, the motion of the atoms is constrained. Put an image of atoms/springs Whilst this may seem like a major leap forward, it is worth considering what the explaination for this behaviour had been prior to this proposal: nothing . Then, using the recently minted ideas such as the equipartition theorem , it was clear why the C/N= 3 k_\\mathrm{B} . To see this, recall that for a gas in thermal equilibrium, we have C_V/N = f/2 k_\\mathrm{B} where f is the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, or stated another way: each degree of freedom contributes k_\\mathrm{B}/2 to the heat capacity. Immediately, we can see that the Dulong\u2013Petit law is of this form, but suggests that the number of DoF is six, i.e. twice that of an ideal monatomic gas. What is the difference between the heat capacities C_V and C_P ? What is the relationship between the two quantities, and what is the implication for the heat capacity of solids? As the heat capacity of an object is defined through \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T} , one must consider the different thermodynamic processes (e.g. isochoric versus isobraic) as the heat supplied to the system will be different (e.g. dQ = dU versus dQ = dU + PdV ). It then follows that we define the heat capacity at constant volume C_V and the heat capacity at constant pressure C_P . Linking the two quantities is Mayer's relation, which states that for an ideal gas: C_P - C_V = nR and more generally C_P - C_V = \\frac{VT\\alpha^2}{\\beta} where \\alpha is the thermal expansion coefficient and \\beta is the isothermal compressibility. This should immediately point to the implication for solids: solids tend to be rather incompressible, which manifests in small values of \\alpha and \\beta , and especially small values of \\alpha^2 , and a negligible difference between C_P and C_V . Hence the usage of C ! The thermal expansion coefficients of various elements, noting that \\beta is of order 10^{-6} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{N}^{-1} for squishy things (e.g. soft clay) down to 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{N}^{-1} for things that a not squishy (e.g. rocks) Hopefully it not a mystery why there are additional degrees of freedom in a solid as compared to a monatomic gas: remember that Boltzmann's model of a solid is effectively a collection of harmonic oscillators, so not only could energy be stored in the motion of the motion of the constituent atoms, but also their position, storing energy in the \"bonds\" between atoms. Monatomic gas Property Degrees of freedom Momentum p_x , p_y , and p_z Diatomic gas Property Degrees of freedom Momentum p_x , p_y , and p_z Rotation Axial and end-over-end Solid Property Degrees of freedom Momentum p_x , p_y , and p_z Position x , y , and z This result stood as one of the great achievements of statistical mechanics at the time, as up to (and indeed past this point) it was still considered a fringe theory. So, what happened? Diamond is the worst \u00b6 but also, diamond is remarkable Whilst most people will be familiar with the cool properties of diamond, some things are best seen. For example, diamond is often quoted as having the greatest thermal conductivity of any material, but what does that actually look like? Well, take a look : If one inspects the plot of heat capacities for the different elements, one can see that there are a few outliers, but it should be made clear that these measurements were taken at room temperature. Above room temperature, there is widespread agreement - even better than room temperature - but if one makes the same measurements at low temperatures, the Dulong-Petit law completely falls apart, with C \\rightarrow 0 as T \\rightarrow 0 . And even at room temperature, some materials do not behave as expected, and in particular: diamond. At room temperature, diamond has a value of C/R \\approx 0.74 , which is much less than 3! The remarkable properties of diamond had long been known, and consequently any theory its salt had to explain why diamond was special. Shown below is a plot of the heat capacity of diamond versus temperature: Put an image of diamond heat capacity Immediately one can notice: C is not a constant Things are good at high temperature Things are bad at low temperature and Boltzmann's theory does not do anything to explain any of this. The Einstein model of a solid \u00b6 It is perhaps unsurprising that a both difficult and well-known problem became the focus of attention for Einstein, someone who even at the very beginning of his career showed remarkable insight into physical systems, often reasoning from observations what must be going on, and constructing a theory to make it all work. Following his work on the photoelectric effect and Brownian motion, he was well placed to tackle the problem of the unexpected behaviour of heat capacity at low-temperatures. The model \u00b6 Like Boltzmann's model, Einstein's model was based around atoms in an harmonic potential, but they key - and highly consequential - difference being that each atom is an identical potential, and that oscillation in said potential occurs at a frequency \\omega , later dubbed the Einstein frequency . Basically, he took Boltzmann's model, injected quantum mechanics and asked: what will be the result. It is worth pausing to point out that this was done prior to quantum mechanics having been developed: Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect is widely heralded as the starting point of quantum, but it was not until roughly 20 years later that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was published! So this was a pretty wild assertion. To see the implications, we can make use of our knowledge of statistical physics and the quantum harmonic oscillator: using the energy eigenstates of the system E_n , we can calculate the partition function Z , then the expectation value for the energy \\langle E \\rangle , and ultimately the heat cavity C . Beginning with the energy eigenstates of a single one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, show that the heat capacity for a single oscillator is C = k_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)}{(exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)-1)^2} In one dimension, the energy eigenstates E_n of a single harmonic oscillator are given by: E_n = \\hbar\\omega(n+1/2) where \\omega is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator. The partition function is then given by: \\begin{aligned} Z = & \\sum_{n\\ge0} \\exp\\left[-\\beta\\hbar\\omega(n+1/2)\\right] \\\\ = & \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)}{1-\\exp(-\\beta\\hbar\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{2\\sinh(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)} \\end{aligned} We can then compute the expectation value of the energy \\langle E \\rangle via \\begin{aligned} \\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{Z}\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} & = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}\\coth\\left(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2\\right) \\\\ & = \\hbar \\omega \\left(n_\\mathrm{B}(\\beta\\hbar\\omega) + 1/2\\right) \\end{aligned} where n_\\mathrm{B} is the Bose occupation factor, defined as n_\\mathrm{B}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(x)-1} It then straightforward to extract the heat capacity for a single oscillator through C = \\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial T} = k_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)}{(exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)-1)^2} The above result is stated for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but to expend the system three dimensions we need to multiply this result by three 3 which gives the final result C = 3k_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)}{(exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)-1)^2} Produce a plot the specific heat C versus k_{\\mathrm{B}} T/\\hbar\\omega , providing your code. put code for making plot Looking at the from of C , it is clear: In the high-temperature limit ( k_{\\mathrm{B}} T/\\hbar\\omega \\gg 1 ) we recover the Dulong-Petit law In the low-temperature limit, the heat capacity is exponentially small But what is the physical interpretation of this behaviour? For higher temperatures ( k_{\\mathrm{B}} T/\\hbar\\omega \\gg 1 ), the ability to store energy in harmonic motion is unencumbered, with a decrease in temperature, this ceases to be the case of these degrees of freedom are \"frozen out\". Once the temperature is sufficiently low ( k_{\\mathrm{B}} T/\\hbar\\omega < 1 ), atoms are necessarily in the ground states of the harmonic oscillator; only with sufficient energy ( E = \\hbar\\omega ) can an atom be excited, and with a temperature much less than the energy level spacing, atoms are stuck and thus cannot absorb any energy. It is incredible that Einstein reasoned that this process must be occurring, which prompted him to describe the theory, essentially leading to him inventing the quantisation of energy levels. Harmonic oscillator image Coming up diamonds \u00b6 Attempting to explain the heat capacity of diamond had proven the death knell of all theories up to this point, and so it is unsurprising that in Einstein's original paper on the topic cantered around measurements of the heat capacity of diamond, which is shown below: Plot A plot of the molar heat capacity of diamond as a function of temperature. The plot is somewhat diabolical in its omission of labels and units, which should read k_\\mathrm{B}T/\\hbar\\omega and C~[\\mathrm{cal}~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}] for the x and y axes respectively Data The raw data used to produce the figure of the heat capacity of diamond There are obviously a few discrepancies, but on the whole it looks much better than the Boltzmann model and rightly was seen as a major triumph. But again, the question is why does this happen physically? What is it about diamond that makes is act so strangely? Well if we consider the energy spacing of the harmonic oscillator, \\hbar\\omega , it is related to both the mass ( m ) and the spring constant ( \\kappa ) of the oscillator. For most materials, the Einstein frequency is such that C/N \\approx 3 k_\\mathrm{B} , but diamond has an especially low value of \\omega = \\sqrt{\\kappa/m} , which perhaps is unsurprising given that carbon is light (low m ) and diamond is incredibly hard (large \\kappa ).

Britney Spears' Guide to Semiconductor Physics : a relic of the time. A viral website before the phrase existed, the site does not hold up to modern standards - especially in light of the recent details of the singer's probate conservatorship - but sports surprisingly high-quality quality content relating to semiconductors, especially semiconductor lasers.

In previous years, the solid-state physics and semiconductor physics components of the course have been explicitly differentiated; however, in this iteration, the two will be more closely intertwined, with semiconductors being considered a flourish to the foundations that we shall construct during our adventures in describing matter. Prerequisite knowledge The content covered in this course is complicated, and without the frim bedrock of requisite knowledge and associated competencies, attempts to construct additional structures may be compromised. It is critical that one is comfortable with the following: The principles and machinery of quantum mechanics. Explicitly, an understanding of how physical systems and their evolution are modelled using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, along with a fluency in common examples (e.g. particle in a box, the Hydrogen atom), and a vague familiarity with Dirac notation is assumed. Thermodynamic quantities and concepts abound, with statistical mechanics looming large in the background. Conveniently, you have just completed a course in statistical mechanics, but it will be assumed that you are comfortable with the content It is my intention that you will be required to call upon many of the other tools from the toolbox that you have been developing during your studies, with the explicit aim of further honing these tools, and maybe adding a few to the kit. Delivery of content \u00b6 The course will operate in a flipped-mode configuration, whereby the undergirding principle is that your out-of-class time is used to consume prepared content (e.g. lectures ) and scheduled times are used for discussions in a problem-based learning framework. I prefer to refer to the lecture-style material as the content download , and interactive, active-learning sessions as the content unpacking component. Subject matter \u00b6 The content for this course draws heavily from off the excellent text The Oxford Solid State Basics by Steven H. Simon , and the book is a prescribed text for the course, that is, it is assumed that you will access to this book. This particular text was chosen because of its concise discussion of the content, its accessibility, and the wry whit which permeates the content, in concert with the availability of freely distributed pre-print of the book . I will be working from the printed text, and I encourage you to do the same. Unsupported material Steven himself has said that the preprint is roughly 85% of the book; however, if you elect to work from the preprint, you do so at your own risk. Course outline \u00b6 Course summary This subject is designed to serve as an introduction into the field of solid-state physics. Solid-state physics is the largest field of condensed matter physics, which itself is the largest branch of physics, and so there is only so material we will cover. The trajectory we shall take begins with bulk descriptors of solids, into considering the fundamental nature of solids, collective behaviour within solids, and the place of these systems in the real world. A rough outline of the course is as follows: An introduction to solid-state physics The structure of materials Solids in one dimension The geometry of solids Electrons in solids Magnetism with approximately one week devoted to each topic, but with the natural ebb and flow ultimately dictating the timeline. Content download A brief summary of the topics discussed in the content download sessions is shown below: Video Topic(s) discussed w0v01 Introduction: solid-state physics information w1v01 Specific heat of solids w1v02 The Drude model w1v03 The Sommerfeld model Support \u00b6 You are not on this journey alone: there are many avenues available to you to help you on the journey. Depending on your inclination to play antiquated video games, you may recognise this as a scene from The Legend of Zelda . \" We are all in this together \" \u00b6 The course materials as consumed through the content download components are necessarily an individual effort, but in all other facets I strongly encourage collaboration. The structure of content unpacking sessions is deliberately geared towards discussion, the exchange of ideas, and collective problem solving moreso than the execution of a solution finding program. Computational resources \u00b6 As part of the course, it will be expected that you perform calculation and computations. You are welcome to do this in which ever language you prefer, but it is strongly recommended that you use Python , and indeed, this is the only language that will be supported. In order to ensure equitable and easy access to Python computing resources, a Jupyter Notebook server has been established, which allows for one to write and execute code via a web browser. The server is named Jove 1 , and access is through the JupyterHub portal . You will need to create an account to start using the server, but beyond this is should be click and go. Materials and exercises may be deployed directly to Jove via Binder Should you have a machine upon which you already have, or you wish to deploy, your own instance of Python , this is perfectly acceptable, but note that you will have to manually import and distributed materials into Jupyter. As it stands, there would be no requirement for any packages not included in the Anaconda distribution.
