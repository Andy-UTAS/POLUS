Make sure you include the labels of the cables used in your report. {\\em Check with your demonstrator to see if the cables you are using have the properties you think they do!} \\item There may be multiple reflected pulses in the system, some with very low amplitudes; search the oscilloscope trace carefully and relate observed features to physical boundaries in the system to make sure you understand the paths the signal may be taking. \\end{itemize} \\subsection{Theoretical Background} An electromagnetic signal in a wire is a form of wave, with its propagation speed and dispersive properties determined by the medium in which the wave travels. For a wire, these properties are typically summarised by a few related measurable properties: the characteristic impedance Z _0 , the inductance per unit length (L ^{\\prime} ) and the capacitance per unit length (C ^{\\prime} ); these are determined by the geometry and dielectric properties of the wire and any associated shielding. In general when a signal crosses from one wire to another, or encounters a junction, device, or break in the wire, a reflected pulse is generated because the signal \"sees\" the change in medium as an increase or decrease in Z _0 . In the ideal case, when no energy is lost to dissipative effects, the expression relating the incident and reflected pulse voltage is \\label{eqn:vrefl} \\frac{V_r}{V_i} = \\frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}, where V _i and V _r are the incident and reflected voltages respectively, and Z _L is the load impedance (impedance of the barrier, device or new wire). Clearly the voltage of the reflected pulse can be very high, near zero, or even negative, depending on the relationship between Z _0 and Z _L . Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} can be transformed into the equivalent equation for the current using Ohm's law. Similar expressions can be obtained for any wave, for example acoustic waves in the Earth encountering different rock layers, or ocean waves travelling across the boundary of the continental shelf. A transmission line with two conductors like a coaxial or twisted pair cable can be modelled in circuit theory as a long \"ladder\" formed by two wires with some series inductive impedance per unit length along the two wires and some parallel capacitive impedance per unit length across the \"rungs\" of the ladder. This formulation leads to a description of the change in voltage and current with distance along the transmission line ( dV/dx and dI/dx ), the solution of which yields a wave equation in V (and in I). For a single wave solution in one direction, the solution of the wave equation with the characteristic impedance Z _0 eventually gives: \\label{eqn:zchar} Z_0 = \\frac{V}{I} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{C^{\\prime}}}. In a lossless transmission line whose length is much shorter than the wavelength of the signal, the inductance per unit length L ^{\\prime} can be determined from the definition of inductive reactance and the relationship between frequency, wavelength and wave velocity v . The complete derivation is given in Terman (1955, Ch. 4). For the purposes of this lab, the result of greatest interest is: \\label{eqn:lchar} L^{\\prime} = \\frac{Z_0}{v} Equations~\\ref{eqn:zchar} and \\ref{eqn:lchar} can be combined to derive a similar expression relating C ^{\\prime} to v and Z _0 . Using these equations allows the derivation of C ^{\\prime} and L ^{\\prime} from measurements of the pulse v and Z _0 . C ^{\\prime} and L ^{\\prime} are ultimately determined by the construction of the transmission line. A coaxial cable consists a solid conducting cylinder separated from a hollow cylindrical conductor by a dielectric material as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:coaxial}. For inner and outer radii a and b respectively, the properties of the cable are given by: \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:coaxial} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{2\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\ln\\left(b/a\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\ln\\left(b/a\\right) \\end{eqnarray} where \\kappa is the dielectric constant of the insulator and \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0 are the permittivity and permeability of free space, with their usual values. Because the twisted-pair wire has a different geometry, the transmission properties are quite different, and are given by \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:twisted1} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\pi}\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right) \\label{eqn:twisted2} \\end{eqnarray} In this case the two wires have radius r and are separated by a fixed thickness s of insulating material, as seen in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\cosh^{-1} is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, which may not be available on a typical hand calculator but is defined in most spreadsheet programs and mathematical packages such as Mathematica or Matlab. In transmission lines comprising multiple pairs in parallel, the formula must be modified using the rules for combining impedances in parallel. This may become important depending on which twisted-pair wire you are using\\footnote{The burglar alarm wire comprises two pairs of twisted strands, which are combined in parallel by the connectors at the cable ends. In Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}, imagine a second pair oriented 90 ^{\\circ} away from from the wires shown.}. \\noindent \\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm]{TDR/coaxial.pdf} \\captionof{figure}{Cross-section of a coaxial cable. \\label{fig:coaxial}} \\end{minipage} % \\hfill \\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm]{TDR/twisted.pdf} \\captionof{figure}{Cross-section of a twisted-pair wire (single pair). \\label{fig:twisted}} \\end{minipage} % \\subsection{Procedure} Start by connecting the signal generator to the oscilloscope through the T-junction. You will test two types of transmission lines by connecting them to the other side of the T-junction: first a twisted-pair wire (at one of the benches this is a telephone wire, and on the other it is a burglar alarm wire), and then a coaxial cable . Both the coaxial and twisted-pair lines have been prepared with connectors on the end so that you can easily use them in the short circuit (low terminating impedance) and open circuit (high terminating impedance) conditions. Set the signal generator to a single pulse of narrow width. The required cycle time will depend on the cable length. Set up the signal generator and the oscilloscope so that you can see just a few of the pulses on the screen. The first of these will be the generated pulse. When you have the time baseline correctly adjusted, the other pulses will be reflected ones. Ask your demonstrator for assistance if you are having trouble setting up the apparatus or observing the pulses. \\begin{enumerate} \\item Examine the waveforms on the twisted-pair line in both the short circuit (ends of the leads connected) and open circuit (ends disconnected) conditions. Try to associate each feature in the diagram with a physical interaction between the pulse and a component of the apparatus. Sketch or photograph the pulses and label them accordingly. In some cases there may be multiple pulses observed; search carefully for low-amplitude features, and think carefully about their origin. Note that the x -axis of your graph should have the coordinates of time (microseconds \\mu s or nanoseconds ns). In your report, explain qualitatively why the series of pulses decreases in amplitude, as well as the reason for the polarity of every pulse observed. \\item Calculate the speed of the pulses along the line by comparing the time coordinates of the initial and reflected pulses. Express this answer both in m~s ^{-1} and as a fraction of the speed of light. Think carefully about the sources of uncertainty that creep into your result, and include these factors in your reported error. \\item Connect the potentiometer to the end of the wire to use it as a variable impedance termination. Find the characteristic impedance Z _0 of the twisted-pair wire in accordance with Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} as follows: change Z _L by turning the dial on the potentiometer. When the amplitude of the reflected pulse drops to zero, the impedance of the potentiometer is matched to the line impedance. Z _L can be measured with a multimeter. In your report, explain carefully how you determined the condition of minimal reflection and how you determined the uncertainty in your estimate of Z _0 . \\item Repeat the experiment using the coaxial cable (omitting the determination of Z _0 since the coaxial cable is well-standardised at Z _0 = 50~ \\Omega ). Describe any differences in the oscilloscope trace between the twisted-pair and the coaxial cases, and account for them referring to Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} and the impedances of the signal generator and oscilloscope. \\end{enumerate} \\subsection{Calculations} You have experimentally measured the pulse velocity v and the characteristic impedance Z _0 for two types of transmission line. With these data you can calculate the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the lines, and compare those to the theoretical predictions for the two types of line. In this experiment, the length of the transmission line is known and the reflectometry is used to determine the pulse velocity, but in a real field situation we may have the opposite case, in which the velocity is known. In this case the pulse timing can tell you the distance between the signal generator and a change in impedance such as a break in the line (as well as the nature of the break in the line). Do the following calculations for both cables tested: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Use v and Z _0 to find L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} for the transmission line (Equations~\\ref{eqn:zchar} and \\ref{eqn:lchar}). It may be useful to remember that the units for L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} are henries per metre (H \\cdot m ^{-1} ) and farads per metre (F \\cdot m ^{-1} ), respectively. The SI unit prefixes for 10 ^{-12} , 10 ^{-9} , and 10 ^{-6} are pico-, nano-, and micro-, respectively. \\item Using the cable specifications, look up the characteristic impedence of the coaxial cable. Does the value agree with your measurement? Consider the formulae for theoretical calculation of L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} (Equations~\\ref{eqn:coaxial}--\\ref{eqn:twisted2}). Using the appropriate values for the two wires, find the expected L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} of both transmission lines. Do your empirically determined values agree with the theory? If not, discuss some possible reasons for the disagreement. The transmission line properties for some of the cables are as follows. {\\bf Don't forget to specify in the report labels of the cables used.} \\begin{itemize} \\item {\\bf Coaxial cable:} \\kappa = 2.3 \\pm 0.1(high-density polyethylene); inner diameter a = 0.90 \\pm 0.05~mm; outer diameter b = 3.80 \\pm 0.05~mm. \\item {\\bf Telephone wire:} \\kappa = 2.3 \\pm 0.1; wire diameter 2 r = 0.52 \\pm 0.02~mm; pair separation s = 0.90 \\pm 0.05~mm. \\item {\\bf Burglar alarm wire:} \\kappa = 4.3 \\pm 0.1 (PVC); wire diameter 2 r = 0.54 \\pm 0.02~mm; pair separation s = 1.05 \\pm 0.05~mm; Note in your calculations that there are two pairs of cables, connected in parallel. \\end{itemize} \\end{enumerate} \\subsection{Bonus Section} For a couple of extra marks, derive Equations~\\ref{eqn:twisted1} and \\ref{eqn:twisted2} using the definitions of capacitance and inductance together with the geometry in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\vspace{18pt} \\noindent{\\bf References}\\ \\noindent Dickey, J. 2018, {\\it Lecture Notes for KYA211/374}, available on MyLO\\ \\noindent Pain, H.J. 2005, {\\it The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, 6th Ed.}, (Wiley: London)\\ \\noindent Terman, F. 1955, {\\it Electronic and Radio Engineering, 4th Ed.}, (McGraw-Hill: New York) N.

For a wire, these properties are typically summarised by a few related measurable properties: the characteristic impedance Z _0 , the inductance per unit length (L ^{\\prime} ) and the capacitance per unit length (C ^{\\prime} ); these are determined by the geometry and dielectric properties of the wire and any associated shielding. In general when a signal crosses from one wire to another, or encounters a junction, device, or break in the wire, a reflected pulse is generated because the signal \"sees\" the change in medium as an increase or decrease in Z _0 . In the ideal case, when no energy is lost to dissipative effects, the expression relating the incident and reflected pulse voltage is \\label{eqn:vrefl} \\frac{V_r}{V_i} = \\frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}, where V _i and V _r are the incident and reflected voltages respectively, and Z _L is the load impedance (impedance of the barrier, device or new wire). Clearly the voltage of the reflected pulse can be very high, near zero, or even negative, depending on the relationship between Z _0 and Z _L . Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} can be transformed into the equivalent equation for the current using Ohm's law. Similar expressions can be obtained for any wave, for example acoustic waves in the Earth encountering different rock layers, or ocean waves travelling across the boundary of the continental shelf. A transmission line with two conductors like a coaxial or twisted pair cable can be modelled in circuit theory as a long \"ladder\" formed by two wires with some series inductive impedance per unit length along the two wires and some parallel capacitive impedance per unit length across the \"rungs\" of the ladder. This formulation leads to a description of the change in voltage and current with distance along the transmission line ( dV/dx and dI/dx ), the solution of which yields a wave equation in V (and in I). For a single wave solution in one direction, the solution of the wave equation with the characteristic impedance Z _0 eventually gives: \\label{eqn:zchar} Z_0 = \\frac{V}{I} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{C^{\\prime}}}. In a lossless transmission line whose length is much shorter than the wavelength of the signal, the inductance per unit length L ^{\\prime} can be determined from the definition of inductive reactance and the relationship between frequency, wavelength and wave velocity v . The complete derivation is given in Terman (1955, Ch. 4). For the purposes of this lab, the result of greatest interest is: \\label{eqn:lchar} L^{\\prime} = \\frac{Z_0}{v} Equations~\\ref{eqn:zchar} and \\ref{eqn:lchar} can be combined to derive a similar expression relating C ^{\\prime} to v and Z _0 . Using these equations allows the derivation of C ^{\\prime} and L ^{\\prime} from measurements of the pulse v and Z _0 . C ^{\\prime} and L ^{\\prime} are ultimately determined by the construction of the transmission line. A coaxial cable consists a solid conducting cylinder separated from a hollow cylindrical conductor by a dielectric material as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:coaxial}. For inner and outer radii a and b respectively, the properties of the cable are given by: \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:coaxial} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{2\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\ln\\left(b/a\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\ln\\left(b/a\\right) \\end{eqnarray} where \\kappa is the dielectric constant of the insulator and \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0 are the permittivity and permeability of free space, with their usual values. Because the twisted-pair wire has a different geometry, the transmission properties are quite different, and are given by \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:twisted1} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\pi}\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right) \\label{eqn:twisted2} \\end{eqnarray} In this case the two wires have radius r and are separated by a fixed thickness s of insulating material, as seen in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\cosh^{-1} is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, which may not be available on a typical hand calculator but is defined in most spreadsheet programs and mathematical packages such as Mathematica or Matlab. In transmission lines comprising multiple pairs in parallel, the formula must be modified using the rules for combining impedances in parallel. This may become important depending on which twisted-pair wire you are using\\footnote{The burglar alarm wire comprises two pairs of twisted strands, which are combined in parallel by the connectors at the cable ends. In Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}, imagine a second pair oriented 90 ^{\\circ} away from from the wires shown.}. \\noindent \\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm]{TDR/coaxial.pdf} \\captionof{figure}{Cross-section of a coaxial cable. \\label{fig:coaxial}} \\end{minipage} % \\hfill \\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm]{TDR/twisted.pdf} \\captionof{figure}{Cross-section of a twisted-pair wire (single pair). \\label{fig:twisted}} \\end{minipage} % \\subsection{Procedure} Start by connecting the signal generator to the oscilloscope through the T-junction. You will test two types of transmission lines by connecting them to the other side of the T-junction: first a twisted-pair wire (at one of the benches this is a telephone wire, and on the other it is a burglar alarm wire), and then a coaxial cable . Both the coaxial and twisted-pair lines have been prepared with connectors on the end so that you can easily use them in the short circuit (low terminating impedance) and open circuit (high terminating impedance) conditions. Set the signal generator to a single pulse of narrow width. The required cycle time will depend on the cable length. Set up the signal generator and the oscilloscope so that you can see just a few of the pulses on the screen. The first of these will be the generated pulse. When you have the time baseline correctly adjusted, the other pulses will be reflected ones. Ask your demonstrator for assistance if you are having trouble setting up the apparatus or observing the pulses. \\begin{enumerate} \\item Examine the waveforms on the twisted-pair line in both the short circuit (ends of the leads connected) and open circuit (ends disconnected) conditions. Try to associate each feature in the diagram with a physical interaction between the pulse and a component of the apparatus. Sketch or photograph the pulses and label them accordingly. In some cases there may be multiple pulses observed; search carefully for low-amplitude features, and think carefully about their origin. Note that the x -axis of your graph should have the coordinates of time (microseconds \\mu s or nanoseconds ns). In your report, explain qualitatively why the series of pulses decreases in amplitude, as well as the reason for the polarity of every pulse observed. \\item Calculate the speed of the pulses along the line by comparing the time coordinates of the initial and reflected pulses. Express this answer both in m~s ^{-1} and as a fraction of the speed of light. Think carefully about the sources of uncertainty that creep into your result, and include these factors in your reported error. \\item Connect the potentiometer to the end of the wire to use it as a variable impedance termination. Find the characteristic impedance Z _0 of the twisted-pair wire in accordance with Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} as follows: change Z _L by turning the dial on the potentiometer. When the amplitude of the reflected pulse drops to zero, the impedance of the potentiometer is matched to the line impedance. Z _L can be measured with a multimeter. In your report, explain carefully how you determined the condition of minimal reflection and how you determined the uncertainty in your estimate of Z _0 . \\item Repeat the experiment using the coaxial cable (omitting the determination of Z _0 since the coaxial cable is well-standardised at Z _0 = 50~ \\Omega ). Describe any differences in the oscilloscope trace between the twisted-pair and the coaxial cases, and account for them referring to Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} and the impedances of the signal generator and oscilloscope. \\end{enumerate} \\subsection{Calculations} You have experimentally measured the pulse velocity v and the characteristic impedance Z _0 for two types of transmission line. With these data you can calculate the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the lines, and compare those to the theoretical predictions for the two types of line. In this experiment, the length of the transmission line is known and the reflectometry is used to determine the pulse velocity, but in a real field situation we may have the opposite case, in which the velocity is known. In this case the pulse timing can tell you the distance between the signal generator and a change in impedance such as a break in the line (as well as the nature of the break in the line). Do the following calculations for both cables tested: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Use v and Z _0 to find L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} for the transmission line (Equations~\\ref{eqn:zchar} and \\ref{eqn:lchar}). It may be useful to remember that the units for L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} are henries per metre (H \\cdot m ^{-1} ) and farads per metre (F \\cdot m ^{-1} ), respectively. The SI unit prefixes for 10 ^{-12} , 10 ^{-9} , and 10 ^{-6} are pico-, nano-, and micro-, respectively. \\item Using the cable specifications, look up the characteristic impedence of the coaxial cable. Does the value agree with your measurement? Consider the formulae for theoretical calculation of L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} (Equations~\\ref{eqn:coaxial}--\\ref{eqn:twisted2}). Using the appropriate values for the two wires, find the expected L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} of both transmission lines. Do your empirically determined values agree with the theory? If not, discuss some possible reasons for the disagreement. The transmission line properties for some of the cables are as follows. {\\bf Don't forget to specify in the report labels of the cables used.} \\begin{itemize} \\item {\\bf Coaxial cable:} \\kappa = 2.3 \\pm 0.1(high-density polyethylene); inner diameter a = 0.90 \\pm 0.05~mm; outer diameter b = 3.80 \\pm 0.05~mm. \\item {\\bf Telephone wire:} \\kappa = 2.3 \\pm 0.1; wire diameter 2 r = 0.52 \\pm 0.02~mm; pair separation s = 0.90 \\pm 0.05~mm. \\item {\\bf Burglar alarm wire:} \\kappa = 4.3 \\pm 0.1 (PVC); wire diameter 2 r = 0.54 \\pm 0.02~mm; pair separation s = 1.05 \\pm 0.05~mm; Note in your calculations that there are two pairs of cables, connected in parallel. \\end{itemize} \\end{enumerate} \\subsection{Bonus Section} For a couple of extra marks, derive Equations~\\ref{eqn:twisted1} and \\ref{eqn:twisted2} using the definitions of capacitance and inductance together with the geometry in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\vspace{18pt} \\noindent{\\bf References}\\ \\noindent Dickey, J. 2018, {\\it Lecture Notes for KYA211/374}, available on MyLO\\ \\noindent Pain, H.J. 2005, {\\it The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, 6th Ed.}, (Wiley: London)\\ \\noindent Terman, F. 1955, {\\it Electronic and Radio Engineering, 4th Ed.}, (McGraw-Hill: New York) N.

The inflow is regulated by a pressure reduction valve on the cylinder and a bleed-cock valve on the Ruchhardt manifold. The gas flow should be kept low and adjusted carefully since high flow rates will cause the ball bearing to be ejected from the apparatus, possibly damaging the lights, the ceiling, or the students. CO _2 has a very strong deviation from ideal gas beahviour that causes it to cool upon expansion. This strong cooling can make the valve on the cylinder's pressure regulator ice up and flutter, giving irregular flow and making it impossible to measure the oscillations accurately. Use the smallest possible flow rate of CO _2 to avoid this. Make sure you understand the operation of the gate valves and capillary tubes connecting the flasks to the manifold. It is essential that the valves are properly set to first allow the flushing of the system, and then to allow a fixed volume of gas to be maintained during the experiment. Theoretical Background \u00b6 The specific heat of a gas depends on whether the gas is heated under conditions of constant pressure or of constant volume. These two parameters are defined by the equations C_V = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\frac{dQ}{dT}\\right)_V is the specific heat at constant volume and C_P = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\frac{dQ}{dT}\\right)_P is the specific heat at constant pressure where dQ is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of mass m of the gas by an amount dT 1 2 . The ratio of specific heats gives rise to the important physical parameter \\gamma : \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} \\gamma is known as the adiabatic index of a gas. For many gases it is constant over a wide range of conditions. For ideal gases \\gamma can only take certain discrete values depending on the molecular structure of the gas. Kinetic theory considerations give \\begin{eqnarray*} \\gamma_{monatomic} & = 5/3 & = 1.67\\\\ \\gamma_{diatomic} & = 7/5 & = 1.40\\\\ \\gamma_{triatomic} & = 8/6 & = 1.33 \\end{eqnarray*} The object of this experiment is to estimate the value of \\gamma for various gases employing the method first used by Ruchhardt in 1929 3 . Ruchhardt used the kinetic theory of gases to derive a relationship between \\gamma and the oscillation period of a system using only simple mechanical calculations and no thermodynamics. The starting point for the analysis is the fact that for a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic transformation 4 5 , PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} where P is the pressure and V is the volume. This is known as the adiabatic equation for a perfect gas and can be contrasted with the more familiar case for an isothermal expansion or compression, PV = \\mathrm{constant} . When the ball is in equilibrium, the pressure in the system P = P_0 + \\frac{mg}{A} where m is the mass of the ball, g is the acceleration due to gravity, A is the cross-sectional area of the ball, and P _0 is the atmospheric pressure. The overpressure in the system supports the ball and prevents it from falling to the bottom of the tube (in reality there is some leakage from the system and the pressure decreases over time). In Ruchhardt's experiment, a metal ball is free to move up and down within a vertical glass tube connected to a flask filled with the gas for which \\gamma is to be measured. It is assumed that frictional losses are small and that the amount of gas escaping past the ball is negligible compared to the volume of the system. As the ball oscillates, the pressure in the system changes by a small amount \\pm dP. As the ball is displaced a distance y from equilibrium the volume and pressure change by \\begin{eqnarray*} dV & = & yA\\\\ dP & = & F/A \\end{eqnarray*} where F is the restoring force acting on the ball. As long as the displacement occurs on a timescale that is small compared to the characteristic time for heat flow into and out of the gas, the condition for adiabatic compression/expansion is nearly satisfied, and $PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} applies. We can differentiate this relationship \\gamma P V^{\\gamma-1}dV + V^{\\gamma}dP = 0 and connect the adiabatic equation to the displacement relationships by substituting in for dP and dV from above: F = -\\frac{\\gamma P A^2}{V}y . This is the equation for a force acting on the ball that is linearly proportional to the displacement y and directed towards the equilibrium position. The corresponding equation of motion describes a system undergoing simple harmonic oscillation. Because of frictional losses that lightly damp the system, the true equation of motion is slightly more complicated; in this experiment the light damping is overcome by a forcing term, namely the constant flow of gas into the system to replace that which is lost. Fortunately, the period of a constant amplitude, forced oscillation is almost negligibly different from the undamped period as long as the damping is light. Forced oscillations are established by drilling a small hole in the side of the tube. This hole allows a small amount of gas to escape when the displacement of the ball is larger than the height of the hole. Hence the motion of the ball interacts with the gas inflow to produce an additional oscillatory force that acts to sustain the oscillation of the ball about an equilibrium position at the location of the hole. {\\bf For your lab report:} Write out the differential equation of motion (i.e., an expression for \\ddot{y} ), including a term for the frictional losses, and show that it describes a damped oscillator with period T given by \\label{eqn:period} T \\approx 2\\pi\\left(\\frac{mV}{\\gamma PA^2}\\right)^{1/2} Rearranging this equation shows that \\gamma = \\frac{4\\pi ^2mV}{A^2PT^2} The parameters A , m , V , and P are easily measurable, and the period T can be measured with a stopwatch. A look at the rules for propagation of error can help you estimate the precision with which you need to measure T in order to distinguish between possible values of \\gamma (1.40, 1.33, etc.). Procedure \u00b6 From the theoretical background, you have found a relationship between the oscillation period and adiabatic index in a gas system that depends on the volume. By measuring the period at a succession of different volumes, an accurate estimate of \\gamma may be obtained. In this experiment you will measure the oscillation periods at six different values of the system volume. The number of gas bottles that participate in the oscillation may be varied by controlling the values in the system, so that the volume changes from six flasks all the way down to a single flask. You will likely find it easiest to start with the largest volume, i.e., all six flasks connected, and work your way down to the single flask. First the system must be prepared by flushing out the previous gas that fills the bottles. It is essential that the system be well-flushed out when changing gases-- a minimum of 15 minutes flushing time is recommended. The new gas should be introduced via the pinch-cocks and fine copper tubes. These extend to the bottom of the bottle and the flushing action is likely to be most effective if a heavy gas is used to displace a lighter one. Hence you should make your measurements first with air, then with argon, and finally with CO _2 . Detailed instructions (and diagrams) may be found in the grey notebook on the lab bench nearest the Ruchhardt apparatus. If necessary, start the oscillations by briefly holding your thumb over the top of the glass tube. This will cause the pressure to build up and slightly compress the air inside the flasks, overcoming the internal friction in the system. The gas pressure should be adjusted very carefully using the stopcock so that the ball oscillates with constant amplitude. Repeat the measurements for each of the possible values of V, and each of the gases. You will find it useful to time multiple periods of the oscillation in order to minimise the random uncertainties in the results. Calculations \u00b6 Use the method of least squares to plot the relationship between period and volume. Is there any indication of a departure from the relationship in Equation~\\ref{eqn:period}? If yes, suggest possible reasons. Use the parameters from your equation of the line of best fit to calculate the value of \\gamma and the standard error \\sigma_{\\gamma} from your data.

Note that these are not identical to the values from the most simplistic application of classical kinetic theory, partly due to non-ideal gas effects, and partly due to quantum effects.

Hence the motion of the ball interacts with the gas inflow to produce an additional oscillatory force that acts to sustain the oscillation of the ball about an equilibrium position at the location of the hole. {\\bf For your lab report:} Write out the differential equation of motion (i.e., an expression for \\ddot{y} ), including a term for the frictional losses, and show that it describes a damped oscillator with period T given by \\label{eqn:period} T \\approx 2\\pi\\left(\\frac{mV}{\\gamma PA^2}\\right)^{1/2} Rearranging this equation shows that \\gamma = \\frac{4\\pi ^2mV}{A^2PT^2} The parameters A , m , V , and P are easily measurable, and the period T can be measured with a stopwatch.

In this experiment you will measure the oscillation periods at six different values of the system volume. The number of gas bottles that participate in the oscillation may be varied by controlling the values in the system, so that the volume changes from six flasks all the way down to a single flask. You will likely find it easiest to start with the largest volume, i.e., all six flasks connected, and work your way down to the single flask. First the system must be prepared by flushing out the previous gas that fills the bottles. It is essential that the system be well-flushed out when changing gases-- a minimum of 15 minutes flushing time is recommended. The new gas should be introduced via the pinch-cocks and fine copper tubes. These extend to the bottom of the bottle and the flushing action is likely to be most effective if a heavy gas is used to displace a lighter one. Hence you should make your measurements first with air, then with argon, and finally with CO _2 . Detailed instructions (and diagrams) may be found in the grey notebook on the lab bench nearest the Ruchhardt apparatus. If necessary, start the oscillations by briefly holding your thumb over the top of the glass tube. This will cause the pressure to build up and slightly compress the air inside the flasks, overcoming the internal friction in the system. The gas pressure should be adjusted very carefully using the stopcock so that the ball oscillates with constant amplitude.

To observationally check de Broglie's predicted momentum-wavelength relationship for electrons. To use the spacing of diffraction rings on a screen as a measurement of the spacing and orientation of carbon atoms within a graphite target. Equipment \u00b6 \"TEL-Atomic\" 555 electron diffraction tube, 5 kV high voltage power supply, vernier callipers. Principal Data Taken \u00b6 Dimensions of the diffraction pattern produced by an electron beam projected onto a curved phosphor-coated screen as a function of accelerating voltage. Things to Watch Out For \u00b6 The high voltage power supply provides a small current (in the mA range) but a very high voltage. Ensure that all leads and connections are secure and protected before turning on either one of the power supplies. Observe all usual care and attention necessary when working with electricity. The bright spot in the centre of the phosphor screen has the potential to damage the screen if left on too long. Reduce the power supply voltages to zero once measurements have been made. Theoretical Background \u00b6 Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect showed that light, previously considered a wave phenomenon, also displays particle behaviour. In 1924 Louis de Broglie developed a generalised version of the equations relating the wavelength of light to the momentum of photons, and postulated in his doctoral thesis that particles might also display wave behaviour. de Broglie hypothesised that the inverse proportionality between wavelength and momentum should hold true for all particles; the electron was the lightest known particle at the time, so it was the easiest case for experimenters to test, which Davisson and Germer successfully did in 1928. Electrons accelerated by a high voltage have an associated kinetic energy, which means they have a corresponding linear momentum. Therefore according to de Broglie's formula we would expect those electrons to have an associated wavelength. Davisson and Germer tested this hypothesis by placing a suitable diffraction screen in the path of such an electron beam. Diffraction is an interference effect that is fundamental to the propagation of waves, and should be observable for electrons just as with any other wave. However, diffraction gratings developed for optical purposes are totally unsuitable for the demonstration of electron diffraction (briefly explain why in your report), so a quite different experimental set-up must be used. Consider a beam of electrons directed at a phosphorescent target. If the beam is not deflected then it will produce a single bright dot where electrons impact the screen. If a diffusing target is placed in the beamline, then individual electrons will scatter off of atoms in the target, creating a slightly blurred spot on the screen. The atoms in the target are fixed in position, with some regular or irregular spacing depending on the target material. If the electrons always behave as particles, then diffraction cannot occur and the pattern on the screen would resemble a Gaussian distribution. The pattern would change in intensity and width with increasing electron energy based on conservation of momentum applied to each electron-atom collision, but would always have a peak at the unscattered beam position and drop off smoothly with increasing scattering angle. On the other hand, if the electrons can behave as waves, then if the spacing between target atoms is comparable to the wavelength of the electron \"matter waves\", we would expect to see a diffraction pattern caused by interference between electrons scattered from atoms in different layers of the target. According to de Broglie's hypothesis, the electron wavelength is inversely proportional to their momentum, and so the minima and maxima of the diffraction pattern should change in a regular way with electron momentum (and therefore, electron energy, which is directly controlled by the experimenter). For this experiment, graphite has been deposited on a screen as a target. In this form, it is a poly-crystal with micro crystals oriented in many random directions, and we can therefore sample many angles of incidence without needing to vary the direction of the electron beam or the orientation of the target. If the wavelength of the incident light (or particle) is of the order of the separation between the atomic planes in the crystal, the planes will act as a three- dimensional grating. Discuss the following in your report The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is given by \\label{eqn:debroglie} \\lambda = h/p where h is Planck's constant, p is the particle momentum, and \\lambda is the wavelength. h takes the value 6.626 \\times 10 ^{-34} J \\cdot s = 4.136 \\times 10 ^{-15} eV \\cdot s. What is the predicted wavelength of an electron with kinetic energy K = 3 keV? If a ray of light had this wavelength, in what part of the electromagnetic spectrum would it be? Make an estimate of the spacing between atoms in a piece of graphite. Start by recalling that 12 grams of carbon-12 contain 6.022 \\times 10 ^{23} atoms, and the density of graphite is measured to be \\rho = 2.2 g \\cdot cm ^{-3} . This is only a rough estimate because the packing of individual layers of graphite into a solid varies greatly from sample to sample. State any assumptions you must make to derive your result. Assuming you have found that the spacing between graphite atoms is of the correct order of magnitude to demonstrate diffraction of an \\approx 3~keV electron beam, we can try to predict where we will see intensity maxima in the diffraction pattern, as a function of deflection angle and electron energy. Shown below is a simplified version of diffraction from a crystal lattice. The basic equations for scattering in a crystal were derived by Bragg to describe the interaction of high-energy radiation with matter, and Bragg's Law gives us the means to test de Broglie's hypothesis. Diffraction from so-called Bragg planes in a crystalline medium. The heavy solid line in the lower part of the beam path represents the additional path length $\\Delta$s travelled by the electrons in that part of the beam For constructive interference to occur, the path-length difference \\Delta s travelled by the electrons in one part of the beam relative to the electrons in another part of the beam must be equal to an integer number of de Broglie wavelengths, i.e. \\Delta s = n \\lambda . The graphite layers can be treated as a set of discrete layers as in the image above, which shows that the \\Delta s is related to the spacing of atoms in the crystal lattice, d , and the angle of incidence of the electron beam with respect to the surface of the target, \\theta . This geometry yields Bragg's Law: \\begin{equation} \\label{eqn:bragg} 2d\\sin\\theta = n\\lambda \\end{equation} \\theta may not be easy to measure (in this case, because the target is held at/near the centre of a sealed, evacuated chamber, but for planar geometry it is simply related to the deflection angle \\alpha between the undeviated beam path and the scattered electron path: \\begin{equation} \\theta = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}. \\end{equation} \\alpha can be determined by measuring the linear diameter of a the diffraction ring projected onto a screen combined with knowledge of the dimensions of the TEL-555 diffraction tube apparatus (see Procedure, below). Thus a measure of the diffraction ring diameter is tantamount to a measure of the electron wavelength. For your lab report Relate the electron wavelength to the accelerating voltage in the device by rewriting the de Broglie relation as a function of the charge q and mass m of the electron and the accelerating voltage V. Use the relativistic momentum formula p = \\gamma mv where \\gamma is the Lorentz factor from special relativity. Confirm that the electrons in a 5 keV beam are non-relativisitic (i.e., \\gamma \\approx 1). From this calculation you should make a prediction for how the diffraction angle \\alpha depends on accelerating voltage V. Procedure \u00b6 Make sure everything is turned off before you start, and that the EHT is set to zero using the slide control. Check all the connections and leads for safety and then turn on the EHT (switch is at the back). The EHT supply needs to warm up for about a minute before applying any voltage to the tube. Check that the heater is working by observing the glow at the rear of the tube. Slowly increase the voltage on the EHT until you start to see the rings on the phosphor screen. The minimum voltage is likely to be \\approx 2.5 kV. The rings will appear similar to those shown here (the image is a negative of the rings as observed on the phosphor screen). It is easier to see the rings if the room is dark. Starting at \\approx 2.5~kV as the lowest voltage, use callipers to measure the diameter of the two rings and record the voltage in about 5--10~steps up to the maximum of \\approx 4 kV. Make sure you include an estimate of your uncertainties in your tabulated data. As the voltage increases, the rings will get brighter and change in diameter. Higher voltages require a current that has the potential to damage the graphite target -- at all times keep an eye on the graphite target, and if it starts to glow turn off the apparatus for 10 minutes to let it cool. At the end of the data-taking phase, you should have enough data points to graph the trend of ring diameters versus voltage, with realistic errorbars in both dimensions. Both the absolute value of the diameters and the ratio of the diameters of ring 2 to ring 1 will be useful in your analysis. Calculations \u00b6 Some further work is required to accurately link your measurements of the ring diameters D _1 and D _2 to the diffraction angle \\alpha . This arises because the centre of curvature of the electron tube is significantly offset from the position of the graphite target (see the figure below). The distance between the graphite target and the screen is L , but the radius of curvature of the screen is R . Geometry of the electron tube and graphite target The numerical values of the relevant parameters are given in the table below: Parameter Symbol Value [mm] Target-phosphor distance L 125 \\pm 2 Screen radius R 65.0 \\pm 0.5 Glass tube thickness t 1.50 \\pm 0.05 If the target were located at the centre of curvature of the screen, the diffracted beam would travel a distance R, and the diffraction angle \\alpha would be easily related to the measured diameter of the ring. Instead, we need to relate it to the central angle \\phi ( R\\sin{\\phi} = D /2). Using the geometry as illustrated above, show that the angle \\alpha is given by: \\label{eqn:alpha} \\alpha = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{D/2}{(L-R)+\\sqrt{R^2-(D/2)^2}}\\right) Because you have directly measured D, the values in table above can be used to calculate \\alpha . We can now evaluate de Broglie's hypothesis on the wave nature of electrons by comparing the derived values of \\alpha to the predictions from the de Broglie relation and the Bragg condition. What relationship between \\alpha and voltage is expected based on your theoretical calculations? What do you need to plot on the {\\it x} and {\\it y} axes in order to produce a linear graph? Plot the appropriate graph for both the inner and outer rings (this can be done on the same graph). What can you say about the wave nature of electrons based on your results? The simple crystal plane schematic shown earlier dramatically simplifies the situation in a real crystal target. In particular, there is only one value of d given, which could therefore result in only one bright ring for each value of n. The fact that 2 rings are seen means that there are multiple spacings possible in the structure of the target material. Use your graph to determine the average atomic spacings in the target. Compare your results with the dimensions you found in the theoretical background section. Comment on the accuracy of your results and your errors. Use the ratio of D _2 to D _1 to learn the arrangement of the atoms in the crystal. For example, if the crystal is cubic, with adjacent atoms separated by distance a_0 (see below left), then there is a characteristic distance d _1 between atoms, and a second characteristic distance between atoms diagonally across from each other in the crystal lattice. This right-hand panel of the image below shows the face-on projection of a hexagonal crystal. Each pair of atoms constitutes an aperture that can produce diffraction. Left: Face-on view of a single cell of a cubic crystal structure showing the possible spacings between atoms Right: face-on view of a single cell of a hexagonal crystal structure showing the possible spacings Both cases produce two distinct diffraction rings, but with differing ratios D _2 :D _1 Show that for a cubic crystal the ratio D _2 :D _1 should be \\sqrt{2} :1. Show that a hexagonal crystal also creates effectively two relevant spacings, and that they are in the ratio of \\sqrt{3} :1. Why does the apparatus used here produce rings instead of bright spots perpendicular to the atomic separations?

However, you will need to have power, so beware of cables on the floor and other students in the laboratory. \\item Transducers, Arduino board, oscilloscope and computer are all already wired up. There is no need for you to connect or disconnect anything. \\end{itemize} \\subsection{Setting Up the Transducers} The transducers are designed to operate at about 40 kHz. It is advantageous, however, to \"fine tune\" your pair so that they are operating at peak efficiency. Switch on the signal generator, and place transmitter and receiver facing each other less than a metre apart. Make sure that the transmitter is connected to the signal generator and that the receiver is connected to its amplifier (small metal box), which must be powered up. Use the C.R.O. to observe the amplifier output. Boot up the computer, and start the Arduino IDE. Load the file called tone_pin8.ino. The file should be located at \"C:\\textbackslash\\textbackslash Users\\textbackslash Public \\textbackslash Public Documents \\textbackslash Ultrasonic \\textbackslash tone_pin8.ino\". This file has comments next to the commands which should explain what each one does. In the preamble variables are defined: FREQ in Hertz, duty and period in microseconds. \\begin{itemize} \\item {\\it FREQ} allows you to set the frequency of the ultrasound emitted. Edit the value to about 40 kHz. \\item {\\it duty} or duty cycle, sets how long each ultrasonic pulse lasts. \\item {\\it period} sets the time between the pulses. \\end{itemize} The \"setup\" section configures the hardware on the board, the \"loop\" section has commands which are repeated endlessly. Save the file (shortcut; ctrl-s). The new parameters are loaded on the board by uploading the sketch file to the Arduino, (shortcut; ctrl-u). Experiment with values of {\\it duty} and {\\it period} to familiarise your self with what they represent. Now alter frequency until you find value which gives the maximum receiver output amplitude - and write it down in your lab notes! The transducers are now \"tuned\". \\subsection{Introductory Experiment} Move the equipment trolley to a position about 1 metre from a smooth wall, or even better, a large pane of glass. Arrange the transmitter and receiver to be equidistant from the wall, one on either side of the sound absorbing screen. Use whatever simple tests you can devise to satisfy yourself that the receiver is indeed detecting a signal reflected off the wall. Just observing the reflected signal tells you nothing about the travel time of a particular wavefront from transmitter to wall and back, because all wavefronts are identical. Devise a means of measuring the travel time of the leading wave front of a particular burst of ultrasound. You will need to think carefully about what the trigger controls on the C.R.O. do, and about the significance of the various modes of trigger operation. It may also help to consider the following questions : \\begin{itemize} \\item Roughly how long, in milliseconds, will it take the first wave front of a burst to travel to the wall and back? \\item During this time, what will the output of the receiver be? \\item How can you trigger a sweep of the C.R.O. at the instant that you start a burst of ultrasound? \\end{itemize} You will also need to consider the period of the ultrasound bursts. Does your next burst from the transmitter occur before the reflection arrives at the receiver, confusing the temporal association of the transmitted with the reflected burst? Observe the time between your burst of ultrasound and the reflection. Is your prediction of travel time confirmed? You should discuss in your report how you confirmed that the time measurement taken was indeed for the same burst. The transmitter doesn't perform optimally when it is fed with a chopped sine wave and the amplitude of the sine wave is rather large at around 5V. Zoom in on the oscilloscope and look at the ~40 kHz waveform from the Arduino. The reflected signal isn't an exact copy, something akin to ringing is occurring in the transmitter, in addition to dispersion in the air and by the reflecting surface. Note that a certain amount of ultrasound penetrates through and diffracts around the sound-proof screen, so that the received signal is not zero during the \"off\" periods. By moving the transmitter and receiver about you should be able to minimise this unwanted signal. \\subsection{Procedure} Using your setup, which should now be optimally tuned, you will measure the velocity of sound in the air and investigate its dependence on the temperature and humidity of the air in which it propagates. \\begin{enumerate} \\item You now have a sort of sonar apparatus. Set it up so that the sound emitted reflects directly back to the receiver. Measure the transit distance using the measuring tape provided. Note that the groove on the transducer tube can be used to ascertain the position of the transducer in the tube. {\\it Do not stick measuring tape inside the tube.} Measure transit time from the oscilloscope. Repeat the measurements over as wide a range of transmitter-to-wall distances as possible. You will plot a graph from this data and fit a linear function to it. You should be able to measure out to about 4-5 metres from the reflecting surface. \\item Before and after your observations you should make some meteorological observations. On the trolley you should find a digital thermometer and humidity instrument, so keep a record of these values (it can be programmed to sample and record these values, it has a USB interface for communication) . One meteorological observation we are {\\it not} asking you to make is a measurement of the barometric pressure. Why not? \\item You should take a set of readings in a cold dark room for example, and another set in a warm environment, where the ambient temperatures differ as much as possible. A set of readings on a different day with different humidity would also be instructive. \\end{enumerate} \\subsection{Calculations} Having done all the above, you can now consider analysing your transit time measurements. First consider the following possible source of error. The oscilloscope time-base may be inaccurate. The calibration of time-base speeds around 1 ms. per cm. can be checked by feeding the C.R.O. with a wave of accurately known frequency and comparing its period with the period indicated on the C.R.O. screen. The Rhodes and Schwarz SMX signal generator in Lab 2 is a quality reference instrument. (This error applies more to the old analogue oscilloscopes, rather than the digital models, but worth checking). If a correction is necessary make sure that you get it the right way round; it is easy to make a mistake. Plot transit time versus distance. (The free R statistical software, or perhaps Python, are to be preferred over Excel, if you wish to become familiar with scientific grade tools) Use your graph or software to calculate the speed of sound. (This is rather a back to front approach for a ranging experiment. In practice one would measure the transit time and calculate the distance using an assumed speed of sound, but we are concerned with variations in the speed.) Remember to note estimates of distance and time measurement errors, as well as temperature and humidity error. These will contribute to an error in velocity. (Once again R has excellent tools for these kinds of calculations.) Carefully read the section in Kaye and Laby1 on the speed of sound in air. A diagram from a paper by Harris2 is included with these notes. (A copy of the complete paper is in the information folder.) The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics3 contains some useful tables too. What meteorological parameters particularly affect the speed of sound in air? Use your meteorological observations and the information in Kaye and Laby or elsewhere to estimate the speed of sound in your work area during your experiment. How does it compare with the value you obtain? Alternatively, start with your value of velocity and correct it to 0 ^{\\circ} C and zero humidity. How does this compare with the book value? How many standard deviations (from your error estimate) is your value from the theoretical? \\subsection{Questions to Address in the Report} \\begin{enumerate} \\item With reference to the expression for speed of sound in any gas, show why pressure is not important in determining the speed of sound; by using the value for the gas constant R and the molecular mass of dry air, derive an expression for the speed that only depends on temperature. \\item Especially concerning humidity , you could discuss the composition of air in terms of monatomic, diatomic and triatomic molecules, and how this affects the gamma value; the ratio of the specific heat of gas at constant pressure, to that at constant volume.

Uncertainties \u00b6 Any result or measurement which is presented numerically should always be accompanied by a numerical estimate of its accuracy or reliability. Values will normally be presented in the form b \\pm \\Delta b . The reader of the report will know that they can expect the true value of the quantity to be within \\Delta b of b with some high degree of probability. In physics it is common to refer to the uncertainties as the errors , and the value of \\Delta b as the errorbar (named for the way the quantity appears on a graph), but this does not imply that the experimenter made a blunder or mistake! Every experiment carries errors with it and no quantity can be measured perfectly. The goals of experimental physics are to minimise errors as much as possible, and to understand the circumstances that produce the remaining errors. By convention, the values of \\Delta b are referred to the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution because this allows them to be easily manipulated and combined according to the rules below. Under this convention, the uncertainty estimate \\Delta b is often referred to by the Greek letter \\sigma (sigma). Because of the shape of the normal distribution, the true value of b is only expected to fall within the range b \\pm \\sigma about 68\\% of the time. b will be found within 2 \\sigma of the true value about 95\\% of the time, and within 3 \\sigma over 99.7\\% of the time (keep in mind that real errors are rarely perfectly normally distributed, and real results seem to fall more than 3 \\sigma away from their expectation values with discouragingly high frequency). Standard rules exist for the estimation of \\Delta b . They vary according to the circumstances of the measurement, and are summarised below. For more detailed treatments, refer to the textbooks on experimental errors and on treatment of statistical data 1 2 3 Estimating uncertainty \u00b6 A single, direct measurement \u00b6 A direct estimate of \\Delta b must be made. This will take account the method used and the difficulty encountered in the observation. For example, the width of the pointer on a dial meter, parallax between the pointed and the printed scale, imprecision in the markings on a ruler, or the manufacturer's claims about the accuracy of a voltmeter. This may also include a component to allow for the judgment (good, bad, or otherwise) of the observer. Note that there is a strong human tendency at the subconscious level to underestimate the uncertainties associated with any particular measurement. A derived quantity \u00b6 When a quantity is determined by combining measurements of a number of directly measured quantities, the techniques of propagation of error must be employed. Let the desired result X be some function of a set of measurements, a, b, c, ... , of different quantities. The errors in each measurement, \\Delta a , \\Delta b , ..., are assumed known. Then \\left( \\Delta X \\right) ^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial a} \\Delta a \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial b} \\Delta b \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial c} \\Delta c \\right) ^2 \\dots The symbol \\partial refers to a partial derivative; ask your demonstrator for assistance if you forget how these work. The general rule for propagation of error can be reduced to some simple arithmetic forms for a number of commonly encountered cases, for example: Error in a sum or difference \u00b6 X = a \\pm b \\Delta X = \\sqrt{\\left( \\Delta a \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\Delta b \\right) ^2} Note that the error \\Delta X is the same whether a and b are added or subtracted. However the {\\it fractional} error, \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} , will be very different. In particular, if a and b are nearly equal, the fractional error in their difference may be enormous. The relation for \\Delta X can obviously be extended to the sum or difference of any number of quantities. The key feature is that the uncertainty \\Delta X is never less than the largest uncertainty on any of the components of X . Error in a product or quotient \u00b6 X = a \\times b or X = a/b \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\Delta b}{b}\\right) ^2} Again this can be extended to the products and/or quotients of any number of quantities. This is very similar-looking to the relation for sums and differences, but in this case it is the {\\it fractional} errors that are added in quadrature to derive the final uncertainty. The key feature here is that the fractional uncertainty on \\Delta X is never less than the largest fractional uncertainty among the components of X . Errors in quantities raised to powers \u00b6 X = a^n \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} = n \\left( \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) This can be calculated from the basic rule using partial derivatives, but it is a particularly useful relation to have in mind when analysing your data. For example, if the fractional error on a measured velocity is 5\\%, then the fractional error on the associated kinetic energy ( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 ) is 10\\%, because the velocity is squared in the energy calculation. Errors in evaluations of functions \u00b6 If X = f(a) , then the basic rule for propagation of error from the sum of squares of the partial derivative of X with respect to a must be followed. Example: X = a \\sin(b) According to the partial derivative rule, \\left(\\Delta X\\right)^2 = \\left( \\Delta a \\sin b\\right)^2 + \\left( a\\Delta b \\cos b\\right)^2 . This can result in some apparently strange behaviour: in this example, \\Delta X is insensitive to errors in a when b \\approx 0 or \\approx \\pi , but will be insensitive to errors in b when b \\approx \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2} or a \\approx 0 . A quantity measured many times \u00b6 A reasonable way of improving the precision of a measurement is to make a number of independent estimates of the quantity if possible. The best estimate of the true value of the quantity is then the mean of the individual results ( \\bar{b} ), and we can try to disentangle two different contributions to the total uncertainty: a statistical component arising from random, uncorrelated measurement errors, and a systematic component that affects all of the measurements (for example, an incorrectly calibrated thermometer, or something that depends on a consistent delay in your reaction time). The random component can be reduced by repeat measurements, but the systematic component cannot-- so note that if the systematic component is large it is futile to attempt to reduce the total uncertainty by repeating the measurements multiple times. In order to find the random component of the uncertainty in a measurement, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the sample, s . The quantity s represents the degree of scatter in the data, and if the uncertainties are truly random then s should be normally distributed. The relationship between the error in a single measurement and the error in the mean of N independent measurements is simply given by \\Delta \\bar{b} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} . Note that in the ideal case, the uncertainty on each measurement \\Delta b is the same, and s = \\Delta b . Significance of the result \u00b6 The number of significant figures in the result should be consistent with the stated accuracy. For example, 3.9 \\pm 0.0798234 and 3.93765 \\pm0.08 are both incorrect, while 3.94 \\pm 0.08 would be acceptable. Since the standard error is only an estimate of where you believe the 68\\% probability limits lie, experimenters sometimes drop the last digit of precision if they feel the rounded off value more accurately represents the state of knowledge about the measured quantity. Always bear in mind that systematic errors often dominate the total uncertainty, and these may be both large and difficult to quantify. Least-squares fit to a straight line \u00b6 Given a set of points ( x_i , y_i ), we often need to find m , b such that the line y = mx + b gives the best straight line fit to the data in the \"least squares\" sense. That is, the required line is such that the sum of the squares of the discrepancies of each point from the closest point on the line is a minimum. This is best done by using a computer (or some graphics calculators). Statistics programs will estimate the most likely slope m and intercept b from the data supplied. They will also estimate the standard errors \\sigma_m and \\sigma_b of m and b respectively. With these four numbers, one can say that, if there really is a linear relation between x and y , then the slope of that relation has a 68\\% chance of lying within \\pm \\sigma_m of m and the intercept has a 68\\% chance of lying within \\pm \\sigma_b of b . The theory underlying the method, and the procedure for computing linear least-squares fits by hand is given in the texts referred to in the Introduction above, and many other places. Warnings \u00b6 Measuring a quantity many times and performing a least-squares fit will assist you in estimating the random uncertainty due to statistical effects, but will not help you in determining possible systematic errors. This will require some common sense, some physical reasoning, and some experience. You will have to judge the systematic errors as best you can, and then combine them appropriately with your statistical uncertainty estimates. Never apply linear regression calculations to a set of figures unless you have plotted a graph and confirmed that the results are consistent with a linear relation! A common occurrence is to have something go wrong in the experiment which transforms the points into a gentle curve. The experimenter may plug the data into a line-fitting routine, which always comes up with a result. If the curve is small, then the reported standard error in the slope will be small, and there may be no indication that the result is in fact meaningless. {\\it Always} plot a graph of your data. Then, if the results are consistent with a straight line, use a least-squares fitting routine. In some of the experiments in \\unitname , the results take the form of a power law, which can easily be transformed into a straight line suitable for fitting. Communication \u00b6 Log books \u00b6 It is likely that in any study that you have undertaken which involves project work that you have been encouraged in to keep a log book. In many instances, these can often appear as a collection of scribbles: a date, a few measurements, maybe a table of raw data, but rarely is there a formal structure or in reality, anything that will remain useful. This is unfortunate, as in practice, logbooks are a cornerstone of rigorous and efficient work. The realisation that this is the case typically comes after some extended period of working on a complex project, where it is simply too difficult to recall minor technical details or re-tread a train of thought, which leaves you wondering \"what on Earth was I thinking/doing?\". It is in this context the we seek to embed the practice of careful, reasoned, and useful log-book keeping. The general idea \u00b6 Rather than thinking of a log as a cache of details pertinent to a given project, one should try to think of an experimental log as capturing your background research, experimental plan(s), methods and techniques, experimental data, data analysis, presentation of results, and conclusions but in a less formal and highly-educative manner. As much as you are writing to convince someone reading the log, you can use it to reason with yourself, in a way which allows the document to act as a conduit to place you back into your state of mind at the time of writing. It can often be difficult to appreciate the need for such diligent record keeping in the abstract, but this will have to be a leap of faith. Think of it like brushing your teeth: something the you are essentially forced to do, and at a later stage you a thankful that you have a habit that really improves your life. The log mantra \u00b6 A log should not be constructed in a prescriptive way, although there will be many common elements incorporated in well-maintained logs. In the specific case of an experimental log for a single project, you will have some materials to point you in the direction of what you are to investigate. From here, you can write something along the lines of a background section. This would contain a broad summary what you expect that you are going to do. What might be the aim of the experiment, and what are the relevant phenomenon. It should be emphasised that we are trying to move away from right and wrong, and rather discuss things that might be important. For example, if one is going to be performing an experiment involving diffraction, it may be worthwhile to explain what underpins the phenomenon: what exactly is the origin of diffraction? What are the implications of diffraction occurring, and how might these manifest in the experiment. The scope and explicit content to cover will be dependent on the experiment, but you want to provide yourself and the reader a comprehensive discussion of the phenomenon under investigation. With the (back)ground work laid, one basically enters the real-time cycle of writing a scientific method stream of consciousness: What do I want to do? Why do I want to do it? How am I going to do it? Why am I going to do it that way? What did I see? Why did I see it? What are the implications of seeing it? Once again, the exact flavour of this will depend on the task at hand, but basically you want to be explaining what you are doing and critically, why you are doing it. The markers of a successful log often take the form: I want to do this, and this is what I would expect I see this thing completely at odds to that which I would expect. I wonder why that might be I just had an idea, I am going to test it by doing _____ Okay, the results from that make sense, I know what is going on (proceeds to explain what is going on and implications) You may remark that this is just like the process one would follow for problem solving or troubleshooting, and you would be correct! These processes are essentially identical, with the spice in the mix for scientific experiments, you might know what you are expecting to observe, so it can be tricky to determine if what you observe is that what you think to be \u2013 a void largely filled by theory and simulations but in all cases, careful experimentation trumps all! Hints \u00b6 At first, writing a log is not easy as it requires that one plan ahead, and then often demands that one slow down and parse what the world is offering up. But to be clear: with the exception of the background material, a log is to be written in real time, and consequently mistakes will be made. Mistakes are to be embraced: you can explain what was done wrong, or what was required to correct your understanding. To emphasise: to purpose of this document is to document both what you did, but also what you learned. The presentation of a log is not the most important thing, but it should not be overlooked. It should be well laid out, easy to read, and the thread of the experimental journey should be easily followed. It is simply not possible to construct on scientific report style log, as a formal report has clearly defined sections, whereas a log exists in the moment, but the log should contain essentially all of the information that would be present in a formal report. One of the purposes of a log is to provide a vehicle for the development of ideas, so if something strikes you, embrace it. Do you have an idea for something that could be done better? Write it down. Unsure of one particular aspect of a theory? Write it down. Can you think of a complementary way to measure the same or similar phenomenon? Write it down. Insightful comments and/or discussions which arise from a comprehensive understanding of a given topic and command over the relevant adjacent materials are the true currency of a log, and science more broadly. Logs are individual. Despite that physics rightly is undertaken in collaboration with others, each person should be maintaining an individual log. Feel free to use whichever medium makes the most sense for you, with both physical log books and digital logs (OneNote, Evernote, etc.) being equally accepted and both with their own pros and cons. Assessment \u00b6 Assessment of logs will be conducted in the same way as any other report you have done in the past, in that physical insight and good experimental technique will be rewarded. In addition, a mandatory \"reflections\" section provides a pathway to improving one's logs and log-keeping technique, with the comments from the previous experimental logs to be addressed, with marks being awarded for engagement with the \"reflection\" process Reports \u00b6 The purpose of a report is communicate your findings to others.

Consequently, in addition to the safety content that is centrally managed by the university there are physics-specific safety concerns which are addressed here. Responsibility \u00b6 Safety is not the responsibility of a single person or group, but rather it is a responsibility which belongs to everyone. It is the responsibility of each person to be aware of the risks posed by a given activity, be cognisant of the methods for the mitigation of said risks, and know what should be done in the event of an accident. Moreover, we seek to create a positive culture of safety: this does not mean avoiding activities that pose danger, on the contrary, it is about ensuring we can perform the tasks and activities which enrich the study of the natural world whilst minimising the chance of a bad outcome. Duty of care A duty of care is the responsibility that all of us have to ensure that we, and those around us are safe. Legally, the university has a duty of care to staff and students, but individually and as a society, we have a duty of care to one another: things would be a bit grim if we didn't look out for one another! To co-opt a well-known \"law\" 1 : [You] may not injure [another person] or, through inaction, allow a [person] to come to harm which captures the sentiment well: yours demonstrators have a duty of care towards you, as do your peers, and you have a duty of care to yourself, your fellow students, and your instructors. Understanding risks \u00b6 Risks come in a variety of shapes and forms and thus it is important to be aware of the hazards that exist. It is also important to have a sense of proportionality and pragmatism when it comes to navigating risk: some things are extremely dangerous, but pose little danger when properly managed (e.g. mains electricity), whereas things we judge to pose little threat can be responsible for serious harm (e.g. falling over) 2 . Related to this is our eminently poor ability to assess risk, which can lead to people avoiding swimming for fear of being attacked by a shark 3 , ignoring the fact that they are many orders of magnitude more likely to drown whilst swimming, and likely did think twice about driving to the beach, which is by far the most dangerous activity the one does regularly. The sole remedy for a lack of understanding of risk is education: learning what are the risk, and how are they managed. Promoting a culture of safety \u00b6 Practically, a positive safety culture centres around being aware of hazards, and willingness to openly discuss risk. If you are unsure about something, or not comfortable in a situation, the best case scenario is that you are comfortable to say \"I am uncomfortable with this\" It is not always an easy thing to say, but it is one of the most important ways in which the safety of individuals and groups can be guarded. The purpose of the content here is to convince you that beyond an arse-covering exercise, it is important that you have confidence in that which you do, in addition to providing tools to assess and navigate risk. If you see something that does not look right, please say something. If you are unsure what you should do if something goes wrong, please say something. Contrary to what one might think, we love it when people speak up, and everyone can hopefully learn something from the discussion that follows! Risks \u00b6 The university's prescribed risk management process is documented elsewhere and the physics facilities are governed by this framework. UTAS risk assessment procedure The formal procedure for risk assessment is carried out by the facilities manager and the unit coordinator. A risk assessment is carried out as specified by the relevant policy document ( Risk Management Procedure ) and must be endorsed by the relevant body depending on the level of risk. The risk assessments for each year can be accessed below: Part I labs Part II labs Part III labs Risk assessments are valid for a period of three years with the provision that the identified risks have not changed. In an effort to make the content less terse, less didactic, less abstract, and more useful, some of the safety concerns which are commonly encountered in physics laboratories are discussed in the following sections. Electrical \u00b6 The most common hazard in the lab is electricity, in the form of mains power, but also electrical components and equipment. Given the ubiquity and importance of electrical energy, we spend much time investigating how it generated, transported, and used. We also study how voltages and currents can be manipulated to perform all manner of tasks, notably for the purpose of computation and measurement which explicitly involves the construction of electrical circuits and the usage of test equipment. There is no situation where one would be intentionally exposed to electrical hazards, but you should ensure that you do not connect or power on systems without understanding what they are, or what they are doing. When working with electrical components or circuits, try to avoid unintentional touching or shorting of contacts; in our study of electronics, it is unlikely an individual component will pose severe danger to your safety, but component damage or failure can lead to bad outcomes, for example, very stinky labs! It should also be emphasised that conduction pathways other than wires (e.g. water) and electricity do not mix: so when working with both fluids and electric equipment, one should remain extremely vigilant. Chemical \u00b6 Chemical information Detailed information about chemicals, notably safety and handling information, is often presented in a MSDS . These can commonly be found online, but the university has access to a detailed database through its chemical inventory management software 4 , which is accessible to all staff and students through the login portal , using the details: Field Response Account unitas UserName EVERYONE Password everyone The use of chemical agents is not confined to chemistry, on the contrary, the study and use of chemicals is core to many areas physics. Consequently, chemicals are commonplace in labs, although for the most part will consist of common solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or acetone) but certain labs involve investigating the physical properties of more exotic substances. Any experiment which requires the use of hazardous compounds will detail the risks posed and the procedures to be followed for risk mitigation. In all cases, it is worthwhile following best-practice techniques for handling hazardous substances, namely not handling anything about which you do not know its composition or provenance, using appropriate protective equipment, and following the handling of any substance one should undertake a thorough washing of hands. Chemical hazards are labelled using pictograms governed under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals , abbreviated GHS which are shown below: Radiation \u00b6 Whilst the usage of radiation is not unique to physics, the study of its origins and properties is largely confined to physics. The two flavours of radiation which require special attention are coherent optical radiation (lasers) and nuclear radiation. Nuclear radiation \u00b6 Nuclear materials are widely seen as the boogie man of the material world, which is largely because they are poorly understood. It is important that the study of radiation and nuclear materials not be conflated with the genuine existential risk posed to humankind by nuclear weapons, and indeed, we want a world with the most radiation-literate people so these risks can be assessed in proportion. The sources that are commonplace in the lab are \"weak\" sources, in that they do not pose a direct safety concern when appropriately handled. Importantly, safe handling of radioactive materials requires one to know what is the material: do not handle unknown substances. It is also critical that when handling sources of either \\alpha or \\beta radiation that you do not have any open wounds, or facilitate entry of the material into your body by other means (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, or eye contact) as whilst these sources can be innocuous externally, they can cause serious problems internally. Radioactive materials are controlled substances, and as such they will be managed by your demonstrator, and only handle the radioactive sources when they are required, act reasonably to minimise exposure, and wash your hands thoroughly with nonabrasive soap immediately after handling the source. The presence of nuclear material is indicated using the trefoil symbol Lasers \u00b6 There is no single device more emblematic to the modern world than the laser, perhaps other than the transistor. In any case, they form the backbone of our communication network, lie on the forefront of medical treatment, and everything in-between. Because lasers have so many applications, they come in many flavours, but all share the same property: without the appropriate respect, they can cause serious injury. In most environments, the primary concern is the possibility of injury to the eye, although thermal injuries and internal (DNA) injuries are increasingly of concern with the development of ever more powerful systems. The systems one is likely to encounter pose minimal risk; however, one must never operate a laser whilst wearing anything reflective (e.g. jewellery, especially watches) and never look directly into the path of a laser beam. When aligning optics, beam paths should be contained and one should be aware of any stray reflections. Whilst it is not mandated that eye protection be worn all lasers, it is good practice to wear safety goggles at all times. Hazardous optical radiation is demarcated using the Laser radiation symbol.

Consequently, in addition to the safety content that is centrally managed by the university there are physics-specific safety concerns which are addressed here.","title":"Safety in physics laboratories"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#responsibility","text":"Safety is not the responsibility of a single person or group, but rather it is a responsibility which belongs to everyone. It is the responsibility of each person to be aware of the risks posed by a given activity, be cognisant of the methods for the mitigation of said risks, and know what should be done in the event of an accident. Moreover, we seek to create a positive culture of safety: this does not mean avoiding activities that pose danger, on the contrary, it is about ensuring we can perform the tasks and activities which enrich the study of the natural world whilst minimising the chance of a bad outcome. Duty of care A duty of care is the responsibility that all of us have to ensure that we, and those around us are safe. Legally, the university has a duty of care to staff and students, but individually and as a society, we have a duty of care to one another: things would be a bit grim if we didn't look out for one another! To co-opt a well-known \"law\" 1 : [You] may not injure [another person] or, through inaction, allow a [person] to come to harm which captures the sentiment well: yours demonstrators have a duty of care towards you, as do your peers, and you have a duty of care to yourself, your fellow students, and your instructors.","title":"Responsibility"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#understanding-risks","text":"Risks come in a variety of shapes and forms and thus it is important to be aware of the hazards that exist. It is also important to have a sense of proportionality and pragmatism when it comes to navigating risk: some things are extremely dangerous, but pose little danger when properly managed (e.g. mains electricity), whereas things we judge to pose little threat can be responsible for serious harm (e.g. falling over) 2 . Related to this is our eminently poor ability to assess risk, which can lead to people avoiding swimming for fear of being attacked by a shark 3 , ignoring the fact that they are many orders of magnitude more likely to drown whilst swimming, and likely did think twice about driving to the beach, which is by far the most dangerous activity the one does regularly. The sole remedy for a lack of understanding of risk is education: learning what are the risk, and how are they managed.","title":"Understanding risks"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#promoting-a-culture-of-safety","text":"Practically, a positive safety culture centres around being aware of hazards, and willingness to openly discuss risk. If you are unsure about something, or not comfortable in a situation, the best case scenario is that you are comfortable to say \"I am uncomfortable with this\" It is not always an easy thing to say, but it is one of the most important ways in which the safety of individuals and groups can be guarded. The purpose of the content here is to convince you that beyond an arse-covering exercise, it is important that you have confidence in that which you do, in addition to providing tools to assess and navigate risk. If you see something that does not look right, please say something. If you are unsure what you should do if something goes wrong, please say something. Contrary to what one might think, we love it when people speak up, and everyone can hopefully learn something from the discussion that follows!","title":"Promoting a culture of safety"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#risks","text":"The university's prescribed risk management process is documented elsewhere and the physics facilities are governed by this framework. UTAS risk assessment procedure The formal procedure for risk assessment is carried out by the facilities manager and the unit coordinator. A risk assessment is carried out as specified by the relevant policy document ( Risk Management Procedure ) and must be endorsed by the relevant body depending on the level of risk. The risk assessments for each year can be accessed below: Part I labs Part II labs Part III labs Risk assessments are valid for a period of three years with the provision that the identified risks have not changed. In an effort to make the content less terse, less didactic, less abstract, and more useful, some of the safety concerns which are commonly encountered in physics laboratories are discussed in the following sections.","title":"Risks"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#electrical","text":"The most common hazard in the lab is electricity, in the form of mains power, but also electrical components and equipment. Given the ubiquity and importance of electrical energy, we spend much time investigating how it generated, transported, and used. We also study how voltages and currents can be manipulated to perform all manner of tasks, notably for the purpose of computation and measurement which explicitly involves the construction of electrical circuits and the usage of test equipment. There is no situation where one would be intentionally exposed to electrical hazards, but you should ensure that you do not connect or power on systems without understanding what they are, or what they are doing. When working with electrical components or circuits, try to avoid unintentional touching or shorting of contacts; in our study of electronics, it is unlikely an individual component will pose severe danger to your safety, but component damage or failure can lead to bad outcomes, for example, very stinky labs! It should also be emphasised that conduction pathways other than wires (e.g. water) and electricity do not mix: so when working with both fluids and electric equipment, one should remain extremely vigilant.","title":"Electrical"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#chemical","text":"Chemical information Detailed information about chemicals, notably safety and handling information, is often presented in a MSDS . These can commonly be found online, but the university has access to a detailed database through its chemical inventory management software 4 , which is accessible to all staff and students through the login portal , using the details: Field Response Account unitas UserName EVERYONE Password everyone The use of chemical agents is not confined to chemistry, on the contrary, the study and use of chemicals is core to many areas physics. Consequently, chemicals are commonplace in labs, although for the most part will consist of common solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or acetone) but certain labs involve investigating the physical properties of more exotic substances. Any experiment which requires the use of hazardous compounds will detail the risks posed and the procedures to be followed for risk mitigation. In all cases, it is worthwhile following best-practice techniques for handling hazardous substances, namely not handling anything about which you do not know its composition or provenance, using appropriate protective equipment, and following the handling of any substance one should undertake a thorough washing of hands. Chemical hazards are labelled using pictograms governed under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals , abbreviated GHS which are shown below:","title":"Chemical"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#radiation","text":"Whilst the usage of radiation is not unique to physics, the study of its origins and properties is largely confined to physics. The two flavours of radiation which require special attention are coherent optical radiation (lasers) and nuclear radiation.","title":"Radiation"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#nuclear-radiation","text":"Nuclear materials are widely seen as the boogie man of the material world, which is largely because they are poorly understood. It is important that the study of radiation and nuclear materials not be conflated with the genuine existential risk posed to humankind by nuclear weapons, and indeed, we want a world with the most radiation-literate people so these risks can be assessed in proportion. The sources that are commonplace in the lab are \"weak\" sources, in that they do not pose a direct safety concern when appropriately handled. Importantly, safe handling of radioactive materials requires one to know what is the material: do not handle unknown substances. It is also critical that when handling sources of either \\alpha or \\beta radiation that you do not have any open wounds, or facilitate entry of the material into your body by other means (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, or eye contact) as whilst these sources can be innocuous externally, they can cause serious problems internally. Radioactive materials are controlled substances, and as such they will be managed by your demonstrator, and only handle the radioactive sources when they are required, act reasonably to minimise exposure, and wash your hands thoroughly with nonabrasive soap immediately after handling the source. The presence of nuclear material is indicated using the trefoil symbol","title":"Nuclear radiation"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#lasers","text":"There is no single device more emblematic to the modern world than the laser, perhaps other than the transistor. In any case, they form the backbone of our communication network, lie on the forefront of medical treatment, and everything in-between. Because lasers have so many applications, they come in many flavours, but all share the same property: without the appropriate respect, they can cause serious injury. In most environments, the primary concern is the possibility of injury to the eye, although thermal injuries and internal (DNA) injuries are increasingly of concern with the development of ever more powerful systems. The systems one is likely to encounter pose minimal risk; however, one must never operate a laser whilst wearing anything reflective (e.g. jewellery, especially watches) and never look directly into the path of a laser beam. When aligning optics, beam paths should be contained and one should be aware of any stray reflections. Whilst it is not mandated that eye protection be worn all lasers, it is good practice to wear safety goggles at all times. Hazardous optical radiation is demarcated using the Laser radiation symbol.
