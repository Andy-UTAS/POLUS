History \u00b6 The creation of this site came about from my first teaching experience in semester two, 2021, whereby I was thrust into a teaching role but with little detail about what exactly the role involved, in that there was no documentation outlining expectations around both teaching and content, no timeline of activities, no list of methods or resources, rather everything runs on institutional knowledge. As someone from outside the institution, and a desire to streamline procedures and disseminate information, this site is an ever-expanding resource of things that I have learned, a repository to detail how things are currently done, and provide resources to aid with navigation of the system. What is here? \u00b6 In the first instance, the bulk of materials are items that are pertinent to teaching a course when one has never previously taught at UTAS , but beyond this, I want to have a space for documenting systems and tools that have proven worthwhile in my teaching adventures.

I hope the site is a useful resource, but given I have taken the time to prepare it, please refrain from complaining about its content. I would encourage anyone to provide feedback and corrections, and I am all about using/following best-practise tools/techniques, but ensure to prepare a decent case in order to challenge my thinking when it comes to methods about which I have spent much time researching and developing.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-physics-learning-and-teaching-resource-hub","text":"This site exists to provide a one-stop shop for all things learning and teaching within physics at UTAS .","title":"Welcome to the physics learning and teaching resource hub"},{"location":"#history","text":"The creation of this site came about from my first teaching experience in semester two, 2021, whereby I was thrust into a teaching role but with little detail about what exactly the role involved, in that there was no documentation outlining expectations around both teaching and content, no timeline of activities, no list of methods or resources, rather everything runs on institutional knowledge.
