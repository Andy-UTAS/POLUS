Now this is not to say that nothing was known about the systems, on the contrary: empirical laws had been used to great effect to describe the observable world, but with the increasing sophistication of experimental technique and apparatus, the cracks in certain rules started to appear. The Dulong\u2013Petit law \u00b6 Consider the heat capacity of a solid. Explain the concept of heat capacity to someone without a science background. Said someone can be imaginary if required The heat capacity is the a measure of how much heat, or how much energy transfer, is required to change the temperature of a material. By measuring the heat capacity per weight, that is the mass-specific heat capacity , of a range of different elements, the two chemists Pierre Dulong and Alexis Petit observed the value was approximately constant when multiplied by the atomic weight of the element, stating that: c \\times M = constant where c is the specific heat capacity and M is the molar mass of the material. More commonly, one will see the law expressed in terms of the heat capacity C and number of moles n : C/n=\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T} = 3R where R \\approx 8.314~\\mathrm{J K^{-1} mol^{-1}} is the ideal gas constant 1 . In the physics context, it is much more common do talk about the number of atoms N , which transforms the above equation into the Dulong-Peteit Law : C/N= 3 k_\\mathrm{B} But is this an accurate description? Let's have a look. Shown below is a plot of the heat capacity C 2 (in units of R ) as a function of atomic number: Heat capacity of the elements as sourced from the CRC handbook of chemistry of physics which is pretty incredible. But a natural question arises: why is this the case? Equipartition \u00b6 For a gas in thermal equilibrium, you will have seen that C_V/N = f/2 k_\\mathrm{B} where f is the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom. We can see that the Dulong\u2013Petit law is of this form, but suggests that the number of DoF is twice that of an ideal monatomic gas. What is the difference between the heat capacities C_V and C_P ? What is the relationship between the two quantities, and what is the implication for the heat capacity of solids? As the heat capacity of an object is defined through \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T} , one must consider the different thermodynamic processes (e.g. isochoric versus isobraic) as the heat supplied to the system will be different (e.g. dQ = dU versus dQ = dU + PdV ). It then follows that we define the heat capacity at constant volume C_V and the heat capacity at constant pressure C_P . Linking the two quantities is Mayer's relation, which states that for an ideal gas: C_P - C_V = nR and more generally C_P - C_V = \\frac{VT\\alpha^2}{\\beta} where \\alpha is the thermal expansion coefficient and \\beta is the isothermal compressibility. This should immediately point to the implication for solids: solids tend to be rather incompressible, which manifests in small values of \\alpha and \\beta , and especially small values of \\alpha^2 , and a negligible difference between C_P and C_V .

In previous years, the solid-state physics and semiconductor physics components of the course have been explicitly differentiated; however, in this iteration, the two will be more closely intertwined, with semiconductors being considered a flourish to the foundations that we shall construct during our adventures in describing matter. Prerequisite knowledge The content covered in this course is complicated, and without the frim bedrock of requisite knowledge and associated competencies, attempts to construct additional structures may be compromised. It is critical that one is comfortable with the following: The principles and machinery of quantum mechanics. Explicitly, an understanding of how physical systems and their evolution are modelled using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, along with a fluency in common examples (e.g. particle in a box, the Hydrogen atom), and a vague familiarity with Dirac notation is assumed. Thermodynamic quantities and concepts abound, with statistical mechanics looming large in the background. Conveniently, you have just completed a course in statistical mechanics, but it will be assumed that you are comfortable with the content It is my intention that you will be required to call upon many of the other tools from the toolbox that you have been developing during your studies, with the explicit aim of further honing these tools, and maybe adding a few to the kit. Delivery of content \u00b6 The course will operate in a flipped-mode configuration, whereby the undergirding principle is that your out-of-class time is used to consume prepared content (e.g. lectures ) and scheduled times are used for discussions in a problem-based learning framework. I prefer to refer to the lecture-style material as the content download , and interactive, active-learning sessions as the content unpacking component. Subject matter \u00b6 The content for this course draws heavily from off the excellent text The Oxford Solid State Basics by Steven H. Simon , and the book is a prescribed text for the course, that is, it is assumed that you will access to this book. This particular text was chosen because of its concise discussion of the content, its accessibility, and the wry whit which permeates the content, in concert with the availability of freely distributed pre-print of the book . I will be working from the printed text, and I encourage you to do the same. Unsupported material Steven himself has said that the preprint is roughly 85% of the book; however, if you elect to work from the preprint, you do so at your own risk. Course outline \u00b6 Course summary This subject is designed to serve as an introduction into the field of solid-state physics. Solid-state physics is the largest field of condensed matter physics, which itself is the largest branch of physics, and so there is only so material we will cover. The trajectory we shall take begins with bulk descriptors of solids, into considering the fundamental nature of solids, collective behaviour within solids, and the place of these systems in the real world. A rough outline of the course is as follows: An introduction to solid-state physics The structure of materials Solids in one dimension The geometry of solids Electrons in solids Magnetism with approximately one week devoted to each topic, but with the natural ebb and flow ultimately dictating the timeline. Content download A brief summary of the topics discussed in the content download sessions is shown below: Video Topic(s) discussed w0v01 Introduction: solid-state physics information w1v01 Specific heat of solids w1v02 The Drude model w1v03 The Sommerfeld model Support \u00b6 You are not on this journey alone: there are many avenues available to you to help you on the journey. Depending on your inclination to play antiquated video games, you may recognise this as a scene from The Legend of Zelda . \" We are all in this together \" \u00b6 The course materials as consumed through the content download components are necessarily an individual effort, but in all other facets I strongly encourage collaboration. The structure of content unpacking sessions is deliberately geared towards discussion, the exchange of ideas, and collective problem solving moreso than the execution of a solution finding program. Computational resources \u00b6 As part of the course, it will be expected that you perform calculation and computations. You are welcome to do this in which ever language you prefer, but it is strongly recommended that you use Python , and indeed, this is the only language that will be supported. In order to ensure equitable and easy access to Python computing resources, a Jupyter Notebook server has been established, which allows for one to write and execute code via a web browser. The server is named Jove 1 , and access is through the JupyterHub portal . You will need to create an account to start using the server, but beyond this is should be click and go. Materials and exercises may be deployed directly to Jove via Binder Should you have a machine upon which you already have, or you wish to deploy, your own instance of Python , this is perfectly acceptable, but note that you will have to manually import and distributed materials into Jupyter. As it stands, there would be no requirement for any packages not included in the Anaconda distribution.
