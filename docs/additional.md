# Additional resources

This page is the space for additional resources which may prove to be of some use and/or interest for curious individuals.

!!! info "Websites"
    - [Open Solid State Notes](https://solidstate.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/) from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/): a site after my own heart, given the usage of the same [reference text](particulars/#subject-matter) and the same [static site generator](https://www.mkdocs.org/). Moreover, the open-source nature of their project has proven to be an invaluable resource in providing ideas and aiding content production.
    - [Britney Spears' Guide to Semiconductor Physics](http://britneyspears.ac/lasers.htm): a relic of the time. A viral website before the phrase existed, the site does not hold up to modern standards - especially in light of the recent details of the singer's probate conservatorship - but sports surprisingly high-quality quality content relating to semiconductors, especially semiconductor lasers.

!!! info "Texts"
    - [Quantum Mechanics](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/quantum-mechanics/quantum-mechanics-notes.pdf) and [Quantum and Atom Optics](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/quantum-optics/quantum-optics-notes.pdf) by Daniel A. Steck from the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/): marvellous books that have been diligently curated and provide excellent reading for both revision and learning new content. Note that the Quantum and Atom Optics text contains relevant content and includes some of the most interesting material one is likely to encounter in the realm of quantum mechanics[^1], but it pitched at the graduate level and assumed knowledge of material not taught in the UTAS undergraduate program. I still think it worthwhile as an additional resource, but don't fret if it becomes a bit hard to follow once it gets into the weeds.

[^1]: and I am not just saying this because my research has been in this area, it is objectively true!
