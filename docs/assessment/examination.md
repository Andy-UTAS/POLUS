# Examination

Examinations are a core part of assessment for physics courses at UTAS, and their structure governed by the [Assessment and Results Procedure](../guidelines/211130 [Public] Assessment.pdf) policy. At the discipline level, exams are pretty malleable; however, there are some core principles to which one must adhere. This page aims to provide information on preparing an exam, as well as what to expect throughout the teaching period in relation to examination.

Almost all information regarding examination comes from the "Executive Officer - Teaching & Communications", which in 2021 was [Helena Montauban](mailto:helena.montauban@utas.edu.au), with the other bits of information coming from (the Associate Head of) Learning and Teaching, [Ashley Edwards](mailto:ashley.edwards@utas.edu.au).

!!! danger "Staff changes"
    As of the time of writing, Helena is no longer the executive officer, which may change things into the future

## Exam preparation

### Examination structure
The exact form of the exam will depend on what is requested: invigilated face-to-face exams are no longer the default mode. Request an invigilated exam (Due Friday 20th August)

no restrictions on the type of calculator and students taking in 2-sides of an A4 sheet of notes into the exam then all is sorted.  They are the typical allowed materials that we try to be consistent with across physics units, so while we can make them different the preference is not to.
