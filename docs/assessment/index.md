## Grading

In what can only described as _the UTAS flavour_, the only place that I could find a description of the grading scheme was on [GradeCalc.info](https://gradecalc.info/au/tas/utas/gpa_calc.pl), which is a "free unofficial grade calculation tool", as the [Examinations & Results page](https://www.utas.edu.au/exams) offered little in the way of information.

|  Letter Grade  |  Grade  |  Percentage  |  Points  |
