The utility of demonstrations in lectures as a tool for enhancing the understanding of physical phenomena has not been established as a definitely worthwhile endeavour; however, their use for improved engagement, heightened enthusiasm, enhanced content retention, and entertainment is well established. The study of physics, and the scientific endeavour more generally is to make predictions about the natural world, and one neglects this at their own peril, and deprives students of a rich experience.
