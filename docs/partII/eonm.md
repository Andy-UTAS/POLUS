# Charge-to-mass ration of the electron

![](eonm/header.jpg){: .center}

This experiment uses a kinematic analysis of the helical path followed by electrons deflected by a magnetic field to determine the ratio of their electrical charge $e$ to their mass $m_e$. The ratio is determined by measuring the change in magnetic field required to keep an electron beam focused on a CRT screen as a function of different accelerating voltages (also known as Hoagâ€™s method).
