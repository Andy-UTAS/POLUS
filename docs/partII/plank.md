# Disorder measurement: entropy changes of a rubber band

![](entropy/header.jpg){: .center}

The relation between work, temperature, and entropy is explored by testing the amount of work required to stretch a rubber band at different temperatuers. The temperature is controlled using a very thermally stable water jacket around the rubber band, and the work is found using a strain gauge and data logger.

!!! warning "Experiment unavailable"
    Due to an issue with the apparatus, this experiment is currently out of action.
