# Part II labs

The part II labs are associated with 200-level subjects. Emphasis is placed on supervised independent investigation of non-trivial physical phenomena. Topics of investigation include foundational experiments in classical physics through to modern application-based experiments.

## Structure

Lab work is undertaken as part of subjects [KYA211](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya211-waves-and-kinetic-theory) *waves and kinetic theory* and [KYA212](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya212-electromagnetism-and-thermodynamics) *electromagnetism and thermodynamics* which run in semesters one and two respectively. Lab work accounts for 15% and 25% of the subject respectively, with the expectation that two and three labs will be completed in the respective subjects. Three hours of laboratory time is allocated each week during the the semester; however, experiments are conducted over a two-week period. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants.

## Experiments

Over the course of the two subjects, it is expected that you will complete five experiments. It is suggested that you pick experiments which interest you, but also across of range of subjects to ensure exposure to diverse content.

## Assessment
As part of each experiment, you will be expected to keep a logbook and give a short presentation about your experiment to your peers. Additionally, once per semester you are required to prepare a formal report on one experiment, which will include a peer assessment process.

## Practicalities
Labs take place in the part II lab (room 233) in the [mathematics and physics building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23959304) located on the Sandy Bay campus.
