The part I labs are associated with 100-level subjects. Emphasis is placed on assisted learning and investigating systems which are core to understanding the physical world, with much time devoted to understanding what constitutes making a measurement, and how to quantify the precision of measurements. Topics investigated include from Newtonian mechanics, electronic systems, wave mechanics, and optical physics.

## Structure

Lab work is undertaken as part of subjects [KYA101](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya101-physics-1a) *Physics 1A* and [KYA102](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya102-physics-1b) *Physics 1B* which run in semesters one and two respectively. In both cases, lab work accounts for 15% of the subject mark and 12/16 hours of laboratory time is allocated for the semester. In practical terms, experiments are run every two weeks with a duration of two hours. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants.

## Assessment
As part of each experiment, you will be expected to complete an experiment worksheet which is to be submitted at, and give a short presentation about your experiment to your peers. Additionally, once per semester you are required to prepare a formal report on one experiment, which will include a peer assessment process.

## Practicalities
Labs take place in the first-year lab (room 236) in the [mathematics and physics building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23959304) located on the Sandy Bay campus.
