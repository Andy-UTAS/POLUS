# Part III labs

The part III labs are associated with 300-level subjects. Emphasis is placed on self-directed learning and solving problems in the context of an extended investigation. Topics of investigation include atomic physics, nuclear & particle physics, electromagnetism, and optics.

## Structure

Lab work is undertaken as part of subjects [KYA321](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya321-wave-mechanics-and-quantum-mechanics) *wave mechanics and quantum mechanics* and [KYA320](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya320-advanced-electromagnetism) *advanced electromagnetism* which run in semesters one and two respectively. In both cases, lab work accounts for 25% of the subject mark and 36 hours of laboratory time is allocated for the semester. In actuality, experiments are conducted over a two-week period, with each experiment accounting for 16 contact hours. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants.

## Experiments

Over the course of the two subjects, it is expected that you will complete five experiments. It is suggested that you pick experiments which interest you, but also across of range of subjects to ensure exposure to diverse content.

| Experiment | Branch(es) of physics |
| :-----: | :----- |
| The lifetime of the muon |	Particle physics |
| Microwave waveguides |	Electromagnetism |
| Nuclear magnetic resonance |	Atomic physics, quantum mechanics |
| The production and characterisation of X-rays | 	Atomic physics |
| Scattering of α radiation | 	Nuclear physics |
| Solar spectroscopy | 	Astrophysics, optics |
| γ-ray spectroscopy |	Nuclear physics |
| The Zeeman effect in Mercury |	Atomic physics, optics, quantum mechanics |

## Assessment
As part of each experiment, you will be expected to keep a logbook and give a short presentation about your experiment to your peers. Additionally, once per semester you are required to prepare a formal report on one experiment, which will include a peer assessment process.

## Practicalities
Labs take place in the part III lab (room 232) in the [mathematics and physics building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23959304) located on the Sandy Bay campus.
