The part III labs are associated with 300-level subjects. Emphasis is placed on self-directed learning and solving problems in the context of an extended investigation. Topics of investigation include atomic physics, nuclear & particle physics, electromagnetism, and optics.

## Structure

Lab work is undertaken as part of subjects [KYA321](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya321-wave-mechanics-and-quantum-mechanics) *wave mechanics and quantum mechanics* and [KYA320](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya320-advanced-electromagnetism) *advanced electromagnetism* which run in semesters one and two respectively. In both cases, lab work accounts for 25% of the subject mark and 36 hours of laboratory time is allocated for the semester. In actuality, experiments are conducted over a two-week period, with each experiment accounting for 16 contact hours. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants. Experiments are undertaken according to a flexible schedule, with access organised on an ad-hoc basis, with the exception being a weekly mandatory discussion session, which will be used to plan and discuss experiments, technical aspects of experimental science, and give "whiteboard" presentations.

## Experiments

Over the course of the two subjects, it is expected that you will complete five experiments. It is suggested that you pick experiments which interest you, but also across of range of subjects to ensure exposure to diverse content.

=== "Current experiments"

    | Experiment | Branch(es) of physics | Summary |
    | :-----: | :-----| :----- |
    | [$Î³$-ray spectroscopy](gamma) |	Nuclear physics |
    | [The lifetime of the muon](muon) |	Particle physics |
    | [Microwave waveguides](waveguides) |	Electromagnetism |
    | [Nuclear magnetic resonance](nmr) |	Atomic physics, quantum mechanics |
    | [The production and characterisation of X-rays](xray) | 	Atomic physics |
    | [Scattering of $\alpha$ radiation](alpha) | 	Nuclear physics |
    | [Solar spectroscopy](solar) | 	Astrophysics, optics |
    | [The Zeeman effect in Mercury](zeeman) |	Atomic physics, optics, quantum mechanics |

=== "Experiments under development"

    | Atomic force microscopy | Quantum mechanics, Optics |
    | Optical tweezers | Optics, statistical mechanics |

### Experiment selection

The selection process is a combination of research, that is, having a look through the experiments as they are listed above (especially at the flavour profiles as listed on the experiment pages) and also attending the first common lab session, during which time we will discuss practicalities of the lab program, but you will also be able to have a look at the experiments and informally discuss with the academics responsible for the labs over energy dense foods. Details will be circulated about the event near the commencement of labs.

## Assessment
As part of each experiment, you will be expected to maintain an experimental logbook upon which you will be assessed. There is also a hurdle requirement that for each experiment you will give a short "whiteboard" presentation to your peers about your experiment to your peers. Additionally, once per semester you are required to prepare a formal report on one experiment, which will include a peer assessment process.

### Experimental logbooks

Information on how to prepare, and what is expected for a log can be found in the [reference section of POLUS](../reference/experiment/#log-books).

### Whiteboard presentations

The cohort of people undertaking the third-year lab program is small, and is ripe for collaboration and discussion. Moreover, succinctly communicating complex ideas is a critically important part of the scientific endeavour. It is for these reasons an informal presentation, which is not assessed but is a hurdle requirement for the completion of each lab, will be given by each lab group to the rest of the lab cohort during the common session. It is expected that you will provide an overview of the experiment: what is the relevant physics, what are you going to measure and how are you going to measure it, and how will your analysis take place. This is not meant to be an imposition, but rather a process to reflect, solidify understanding and communicate openly with a group of interested people.

### Lab reports
Information on how to prepare, and what is expected for a lab report can be found in the [reference section of POLUS](../reference/experiment/#reports).

### Presentations
Information on how to prepare, and what is expected a presentation can be found in the [reference section of POLUS](../reference/experiment/#presentations).

## Practicalities
Prior to performing any experiments, it is a requirement that you have completed the [lab induction](../safety/inductions/).

Labs take place in one of the part III labs (rooms 140, 231, 233) in the [mathematics and physics building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23959304) located on the Sandy Bay campus. Common sessions will be held in the part II/III lab (233), which you are welcome to attend (and encouraged to attend) at your leisure.
