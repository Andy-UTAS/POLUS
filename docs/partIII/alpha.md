# Scattering of Î± radiation

!!! warning "Experiment maintenance required"
    The apparatus is currently not functional due to a range of issues, so it is unlikely to be running. However, if you are super keen to do the experiment, [contact us](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au) and we might be able to sort something out.

Students test the angular dependence of scattering for gold, silver and aluminium foil. They may also measure the energy distribution of pulses from the silicon semiconductor detector in order to investigate the source spectrum and energy resolution of the detector. The experiment provides an introduction to the techniques of energy measurement for fast charged particles, the use of pulse height analysis and vacuum systems. It also increases awareness of statistical problems associated with nuclear measurements.
