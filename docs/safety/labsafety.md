# Safety in physics laboratories

One can attempt to disseminate best-practice safety procedures with broad brush strokes, but in many situations, including experimental work in the physical sciences, the risk and procedures are highly specialised and unique to the area or activity. Consequently, in addition to the [safety content that is centrally managed by the university](../) there are physics-specific safety concerns which are addressed here.

## Responsibilities

Safety is not the responsibility of a single person or group, but rather it is a responsibility which belongs to everyone. It is the responsibility of each person to be aware of the risks posed by a given activity, be cognisant of the methods for the mitigation of said risks, and know what should be done in the event of an accident. Moreover, we seek to create a positive culture of safety: this does not mean avoiding activities that pose danger, on the contrary, it is about ensuring we can perform the tasks and activities which enrich the study of the natural world whilst minimising the chance of a bad outcome.

### Understanding risks

<a href="https://xkcd.com/2038/">![XKCD hazard](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hazard_symbol.png){width="250" align=left}</a> Risks come in a [variety of shapes and forms](#risks) and thus it is important to be aware of the hazards that exist. It is also important to have a sense of proportionality and pragmatism when it comes to navigating risk: some things are extremely dangerous, but pose little danger when properly managed (e.g. mains electricity), whereas things we judge to pose little threat can be responsible for serious harm (e.g. falling over)[^1]. Related to this is our eminently poor ability to assess risk, which can lead to people avoiding swimming for fear of being attacked by a shark[^2], ignoring the fact that they are many orders of magnitude more likely to drown whilst swimming, and likely did think twice about driving to the beach, which is by far the most dangerous activity the one does regularly. The sole remedy for a lack of understanding of risk is education: learning what are the risk, and how are they managed.

### Promoting a culture of safety

Practically, a positive safety culture centres around being aware of hazards, and willingness to openly discuss risk. If you are unsure about something, or not comfortable in a situation, the best case scenario is that you are comfortable to say

> *"I am uncomfortable with this"*

It is not always an easy thing to say, but it is one of the most important ways in which the safety of individuals and groups can be guarded. The purpose of the content here is to convince you that beyond an arse-covering exercise, it is important that you have confidence in that which you do, in addition to providing tools to assess and navigate risk. If you see something that does not look right, please say something. If you are unsure what you should do if something goes wrong, please say something. Contrary to what one might think, we love it when people speak up, and everyone can hopefully learn something from the discussion that follows!

## Risks

The university's prescribed risk management process is documented [elsewhere](https://www.utas.edu.au/safety-and-wellbeing/information-and-documents/risk-topics/risk-management) and the physics facilities are governed by this framework.

??? info "UTAS risk assessment procedure"
    The formal procedure for risk assessment is carried out by the [facilities manager](mailto:physics.facilities@utas.edu.au) and the unit coordinator. A risk assessment is carried out as specified by the relevant policy document ([Risk Management Procedure](https://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1370045/Project-Task-Risk-Management-Procedure-UNDER-REVIEW.pdf)) and must be endorsed by the relevant body depending on the level of risk. The risk assessments for each year can be accessed below:

    - [Part I labs](Risk Assessment - First Year Labs.pdf)
    - Part II labs
    - Part III labs

    Risk assessments are valid for a period of three years with the provision that the identified risks have not changed.

In an effort to make the content less terse, less didactic, less abstract, and more useful, some of the safety concerns which are commonly encountered in physics laboratories are discussed in the following sections.

### Electrical

![Discharge](discharge.jpg){width="250" align=right} The most common hazard in the lab is electricity, in the form of mains power, but also electrical components and equipment. Given the ubiquity and importance of electrical energy, we spend much time investigating how it generated, transported, and used. We also study how voltages and currents can be manipulated to perform all manner of tasks, notably for the purpose of computation and measurement which explicitly involves the construction of electrical circuits and the usage of test equipment.

There is no situation where one would be exposed t
