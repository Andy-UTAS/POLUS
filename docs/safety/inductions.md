## Laboratory and building induction

### General rules

* Never work alone in the laboratory.
* Always wear adequate foot covering; bare feet, thongs, open-toed or backless shoes are not permitted. High-heeled shoes are discouraged.
* No food or drink are permitted to be consumed in the laboratory.
* Never run in the lab.
* Long hair or very loose clothing or jewellery may be a hazard around experiments with fast-moving or heavy parts, or machinery. There are not many such situations in our laboratories, but demonstrators may require you to remove dangerous items or tie back your hair before approaching potentially hazardous equipment.
* Immediately clean any spill of water or other liquids. Few of the experiment involve liquids, and no drinks are allowed in the lab, but as a reminder: water and electricity donâ€™t mix. Water must never be placed where it could potentially spill onto electrical equipment.
