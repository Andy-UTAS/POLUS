# Resources

This section is designed to provide a cornucopia of resources, with materials relevant for both UTAS and non-UTAS alike.

The most pertinent and pressing material is to be found in the [FAQ](faqs) section, which could equally be framed as _problems which made me angry to which I found a solution_. Sadly, there are many potential entries to this section just waiting for their solutions.
