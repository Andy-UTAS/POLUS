    "\n",
    "Circuits, and electricity more generally underpins the operation of our modern existence: from computation and automation to permitting construction and engineering on scales previously unimaginable. Modern electronic systems are complex, mainly relying on digital systems, that is two state electronic systems which are either off or on, these systems are still fundamentally voltages and currents: a voltage of 0 V is recorded as \"off\" and a voltage of 5 V is recorded as \"on\". As there is an ever-constant driver for devices do things faster and more efficiently, one might wonder what limitations exist, notably, is there a physical limit on how quickly one can do something in an electrical system, and what is the origin of this limit?\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at circuits, the most important quantities are those of voltage ($V$) and current ($I$) which describe the difference in electrical potential between two points and the movement of charge respectively. Circuits confine the broader problem of free charges and applied potentials to set conduction pathways, which have circuit elements. For example, a battery or power supply can provide a potential difference, and by connecting the terminals of different potentials with a wire, the flow of charge is confined to the wire. A fundamental relation in the proportionality between voltage and current, which makes intuitive sense as if the difference in energy between two points increases, more charge will seek to find the low-energy state. The constant of proportionality between the voltage and current is the resistance ($R$) which describes how difficult it is for charge to travel through the system, with conductors having a low resistance (roughly 1 $\\Omega$), whereas insulators have a very high resistance ($10^6$  $\\Omega$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The system above has one critical assumption: the applied potential remains constant. If the voltage changes with time, which includes a system with a fixed voltage that is turned on or off using a switch, the system becomes dynamic. In the case of a constant voltage that is switched, the system is transient until a steady state is reached, and a time-varying voltage will produce a dynamic system. From Maxwell's equations, we know a time varying electric potential - and thus field - will produce a magnetic field and vice versa. Depending on the geometry of circuit components, they may provide pathways for the storage of magnetic or electric energy, for example, in coils of wire (a solenoid) or conductors separated by insulation (a capacitor) respectively. These components are termed reactive, as how they respond to a given potential depends on the frequency of the potential, and it is this phenomenon that we are going to investigate in this experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to investigate the behaviour of circuits when driven at different frequencies. This means that we will have to make a circuit where the frequency of the input potential can be varied, and then have some way of measuring how the circuit reacts. With this system, we can then collect data at a range of frequencies and compare this to the behaviour we would expect. \n",

It is clear that the waveforms are mostly identical, although there is a slight voltage drop, which must be due to the resistance of the wires and any connections made in the circuit: the resistor is the only element and all voltage must dropped across this, and since this isn't the case, there must be other resistive elements in the circuit.\n",

The reason these values are complex, as is always the case, is because phase is important: there will be a phase difference between the voltage and current when such components are present. The reason for this is because the physics of these elements are clearly different. In the case we are currently considering, when a voltage increases, the capacitor will charge, and thus lots of current will flow, but it becomes increasingly difficult to get more charge onto the capacitor electrodes, and thus the current will decrease and eventually cease. Moving from switching circuits from off to on and going to a circuits driven a some frequency, this means that for low frequencies, a capacitor will charge and discharge, but once charged or discharged, no current will flow. A logical extension of this is that if the frequency is high, the capacitor will neither charge or discharge an effectively become invisible. This is pretty neat, one could imagine that this effect would be useful as a frequency filter or something.\n",

But if one calculates what the time constant would be given an impedance of $200\\Omega$, that would be $.103×200=20.6~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ which leads to a rise time of roughly $45~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, which is exactly what we measured...

The reason this occurs is exactly as described previously: at low frequencies, the capacitor has a large impedance and hence the bulk of the power is dissipated there, and at high frequencies, the inductor has high impedance and the bulk of the power is dissipated there, and because of the associated phase lead and phase lag between the voltage and current for an inductor and capacitor respectively, there is a magical spot in-between the dominance of the capacitor and inductor where their impedances cancel and all power is dissipated in the resistor. The frequency at which this occurs is the resonant frequency, and from the relations of impedance, we can see that this will occur when \n",

    "and marked on the plot is the theoretical value at which resonance should occur. There is good agreement between the theory and the observed behaviour, but I note that the peak is very wide, that is, the circuit is resonant over a large range of frequencies. The width of this peak is going to be related to the resistance, as the charging/discharging time is related to the product of $R \\times C$, so if one was hoping to build a circuit which responded at only a single frequency, this would not be a good design, whereas if you wanted a circuit that responded over a range of frequencies, for example between $1−50 kHz$, this would be a good circuit.\n",

Phase values outside this range suggest whether the system is dominated by either capacitance or inductance, but the explicit uses of phase sensitive circuits warrants further investigation.\n",

    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "When electrical components are allowed to store energy, that is they have non-trivial geometries such that their capacitance or inductance is non-zero, the response of the circuit is going to be frequency dependent. On the one hand, this is obviously more complicated than the static case, but with complexity comes the opportunity for sophistication. Modelling the charge in these systems allows us to predict the behaviour of a given circuit, and notable phenomena of capacitive charging/discharging on the timescale of $RC$ and resonance occurring at a frequency of  $1/\\sqrt{LC}$  permit the creation a wonderous devices. For example, one could imagine using a large value of RC to smooth an AC voltage to a DC voltage, or tune an amplifier to amplify only the signals with a given frequency. It is also clear that due to the impendence of a system, if one wants to observe phenomenon on short timescales, ensuring a small impedance of the testing system is critical. This is because even though the true signal may be \"fast\", the measuring system will measure a \"slow\" signal with a timescale dominated by the detection system. The implications are equally true for trying to switch things on really fast, as any capacitance is going to limit how quickly a system can turn on and off.\n",
