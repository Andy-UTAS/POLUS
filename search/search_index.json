What is the PL&T hub? \u00b6 From where does it come? \u00b6 The creation of this site came about from my first teaching experience in semester two, 2021, whereby I was thrust into a teaching role but with little detail about what exactly the role involved, in that there was no documentation outlining expectations around both teaching and content, no timeline of activities, no list of methods or resources, rather everything runs on institutional knowledge. As someone from outside the institution, and a desire to streamline procedures and disseminate information, this site is an ever-expanding resource of things that I have learned, a repository to detail how things are currently done, and provide resources to aid with navigation of the system. What is here? \u00b6 In the first instance, the bulk of materials are items that are pertinent to teaching a course when one has never previously taught at UTAS , but beyond this, I want to have a space for documenting systems and tools that have proven worthwhile in my teaching adventures. How do I use what is here? \u00b6 Information on course structure, what are expectations, and how to be navigate specific problems should be consumed in a piecemeal fashion, that is to say as needed; however, there is a fair bit of content relating to developing teaching materials and practises, which are probably best used through example. To expand, it is probably best to see a demonstration a tool or method, either through in-person discussion or linked examples, and then treat the content here as a \"how-to\" guide. There is also a resource library, which can be scanned for ideas and inspiration. Salt advised A large chunk of (Mongolian) rock salt.

This site is written, curated, and supported by me and consequently, it is chock-full of my anecdotal experience, my biases, and opinions. I hope the site is a useful resource, but given I have taken the time to prepare it, please refrain from non-constructive complaints about its content. I would encourage anyone to provide ideas, feedback, and corrections. Moreover, I am all about using and following best-practise educational tools and techniques, but ensure to prepare a decent case in order to challenge my thinking when it comes to methods about which I have spent much time researching and developing.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-physics-learning-and-teaching-resource-hub","text":"This site exists to provide a one-stop shop for all things learning and teaching within physics at UTAS .","title":"Welcome to the physics learning and teaching resource hub"},{"location":"#what-is-the-plt-hub","text":"","title":"What is the PL&amp;T hub?"},{"location":"#from-where-does-it-come","text":"The creation of this site came about from my first teaching experience in semester two, 2021, whereby I was thrust into a teaching role but with little detail about what exactly the role involved, in that there was no documentation outlining expectations around both teaching and content, no timeline of activities, no list of methods or resources, rather everything runs on institutional knowledge.
