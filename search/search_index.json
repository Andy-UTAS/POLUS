As part of this course, we will investigate the what happens when atoms are no longer considered in isolation, and see that systems of interacting particles can have some pretty incredible outcomes Course expectations: my expectations of you Solid-state physics is where the rubber meets the road: abstract concepts will be applied in an effort to model realistic and complex systems. There are delights are to be had, but like most truly rewarding endeavours, said delights do not come for free. In undertaking this course, it is expected that: You will view the content download sessions outside of scheduled lecture times Prescribed problems and reading will be undertaken before any content extraction sessions If you are experiencing difficulties, that you will get in contact as soon as is reasonably possible Course objectives The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the world of solid-state physics. At the conclusion of your journey, you should: Be familiar with the main models of solid-state physics, and their application to real-world systems Have proficiency parsing and extracting information from applied solid-state systems, with an eye to identification the relevant theoretical framework(s) and the concise formulation of physics to be investigated Have experience identifying and applying appropriate approximations and physical insight to make difficult problems more tractable Be familiar with experimental and analytical apparatus relevant to probing solid-state systems, in addition to some of the main systems and devices one might encounter in the wild Have had some fun! Course expectations: my promises to you Rightly, you should have expectations of me. It is my intention that: I will work to communicate my understanding and insight in the course material I will actively seek input to steer and shape the content discussed, and develop relevant resources I will be widely available for consultation and discussion I will do my best to cultivate a safe and open forum for discussion If you think that I am not fulfilling my commitments, or if you have other comments, I would hope that you are comfortable conveying your concerns and/or comments to me, either directly or anonymously. It is my genuine desire to help you navigate learning new concepts and ideas, and I want to do this to the best of my ability, and feedback is the best way to ensure this endeavour proceeds as smoothly as possible.

In previous years, the solid-state physics and semiconductor physics components of the course have been explicitly differentiated; however, in this iteration, the two will be more closely intertwined, with semiconductors being considered a flourish to the foundations that we shall construct during our adventures in describing matter. Prerequisite knowledge The content covered in this course is complicated, and without the frim bedrock of requisite knowledge and associated competencies, attempts to construct additional structures may be compromised. It is critical that one is comfortable with the following: The principles and machinery of quantum mechanics. Explicitly, an understanding of how physical systems and their evolution are modelled using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, along with a fluency in common examples (e.g. particle in a box, the Hydrogen atom), and a vague familiarity with Dirac notation is assumed. Thermodynamic quantities and concepts abound, with statistical mechanics looming large in the background. Conveniently, you have just completed a course in statistical mechanics, but it will be assumed that you are comfortable with the content It is my intention that you will be required to call upon many of the other tools from the toolbox that you have been developing during your studies, with the explicit aim of further honing these tools, and maybe adding a few to the kit. Course delivery \u00b6 The course will operate in a flipped-mode configuration, whereby the undergirding principle is that your out-of-class time is used to consume prepared content (e.g. lectures ) and scheduled times are used for discussions in a problem-based learning framework. I prefer to refer to the lecture-style material as the content download , and interactive, active-learning sessions as the content unpacking component. Course content \u00b6 The content for this course draws heavily from off the excellent text The Oxford Solid State Basics by Steven H. Simon , and the book is a prescribed text for the course, that is, it is assumed that you will access to this book. This particular text was chosen because of its concise discussion of the content, its accessibility, and the wry whit which permeates the content, in concert with the availability of freely distributed pre-print of the book . I will be working from the printed text, and I encourage you to do the same. Unsupported material If you elect to work from the preprint, you do so at your own risk. Course support \u00b6 You are not on this journey alone: there are many avenues available to you to help you on the journey. Depending on your inclination to play antiquated video games, you may recognise this as a scene from The Legend of Zelda . Computation resources \u00b6 As part of the course, it will be expected that you perform calculation and computations. You are welcome to do this in which ever language you prefer, but it is strongly recommended that you use Python , and indeed, this is the only language that will be supported. In order to ensure equitable and easy access to Python computing resources, a Jupyter Notebook server has been established, which allows for one to write and execute code via a web browser. The server is named Jove 1 , and access is through the JupyterHub portal . You will need to create an account to start using the server, but beyond this is should be click and go. Materials and exercises may be deployed directly to Jove via Binder Should you have a machine upon which you already have, or you wish to deploy, your own instance of Python , this is perfectly acceptable, but note that you will have to manually import and distributed materials into Jupyter. As it stands, there would be no requirement for any packages not included in the Anaconda distribution. For those wondering, Jove is an alternate name for the Roman god Jupiter. \u21a9","title":"Course particulars"},{"location":"particulars/#course-information","text":"The solid-state component of the course will run for seven weeks, beginning in week 7 and concluding at the end of semester.
