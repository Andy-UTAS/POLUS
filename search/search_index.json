Argon, dry air (O  N), and CO are used as examples of the three types.  is related to the compressibility, the sound speed, and the heat capacity of a gas. Electron diffraction Wave mechanics, Quantum physics A thin piece of highly-ordered material is considered as a diffraction screen with aperture spacings determined by the atomic spacings in the sample. Observations of the patterns that result when electrons accelerated through several kilovolts hit a chip of graphite can be used to prove that electrons can exhibit wave behaviour in accordance with deBroglie's hypothesis, and to probe the spacing and arrangement of graphite atoms on scales 10 m. Time-domain reflectometry Wave mechanics, Electromagnetism The properties of waveforms travelling through cables with different characteristic impedances are investigated. The behaviour of reflected waves from boundaries of high, low, and matched impedance is observed and related to the wave equation, and the characteristic impedance and speed of pulses in a cable are used to compare the cable inductance and capacitance to theoretically calculated values. Ultrasonic ranging Wave mechanics This experiment looks into some of the problems involved in using ultrasonic sound waves to measure the distance of an object from an ultrasonic transmitter. Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary Difficulty Charge-to-mass ration of the electron Electromagnetism This experiment uses a kinematic analysis of the helical path followed by electrons deflected by a magnetic field to determine the ratio of the electric charge  to the mass . The ratio is determined by measuring the change in magnetic field required to keep an electron beam focused on a CRT screen as a function of different accelerating voltages (also known as Hoag's method). Entropy change in a rubber band Thermal physics The relation between work, temperature, and entropy is explored by testing the amount of work required to stretch a rubber band at different temperatures. Hysteresis of iron Electromagnetism Hysteresis in a physical system arises when the internal state of the system depends on the past history of external forces applied, i.e., the system does not return to its lowest-energy or equilibrium state in the absence of an applied force. This happens during the magnetisation of ferromagnetic material in an external field. In this experiment magnetic hysteresis in iron is explored as a function of the size of the magnetising current, and the energy dissipation due to hysteresis losses is explored. Induction and the Earth's magnetic field Electromagnetism A changing magnetic flux creates a measurable electric current in a loop of wire. One way of creating a change in magnetic flux is by changing the orientation of a coil with respect to a constant magnetic field . In this experiment, the strength and orientation of the Earth's magnetic field is measured by observing the electrical response produced during a  rotation of a coil of wire (colloquially known as the -flipper). The Michelson interferometer Wave mechanics, optics The wave nature of light at visible wavelengths is demonstrated by use of a dual-beam interferometer of the sort pioneered by Michelson. By altering the optical path length of one beam relative to the other, interference effects are used to measure the index of refraction of mica and of air over a range of pressures.

Ruchhardt used the kinetic theory of gases to derive a relationship between  and the oscillation period of a system using only simple mechanical calculations and no thermodynamics.  The starting point for the analysis is the fact that for a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic transformation 45,</p> <p> </p> <p>where P is the pressure and V is the volume.

The overpressure in the system supports the ball and prevents it from falling to the bottom of the tube (in reality there is some leakage from the system and the pressure decreases over time).</p> <p>In Ruchhardt's experiment, a metal ball is free to move up and down within a vertical glass tube connected to a flask filled with the gas for which  is to be measured. It is assumed that frictional losses are small and that the amount of gas escaping past the ball is negligible compared to the volume of the system. As the ball oscillates, the pressure in the system changes by a small amount dP.</p> <p>As the ball is displaced a distance  from equilibrium the volume and pressure change by</p> <p> </p> <p>where  is the restoring force acting on the ball.  As long as the displacement occurs on a timescale that is small compared to the characteristic time for heat flow into and out of the gas, the condition for adiabatic compression/expansion is nearly satisfied, and $PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} applies. We can differentiate this relationship</p> <p> </p> <p>and connect the adiabatic equation to the displacement relationships by substituting in for  and  from above:</p> <p> </p> <p>This is the equation for a force acting on the ball that is linearly proportional to the displacement  and directed towards the equilibrium position. The corresponding equation of motion describes a system undergoing simple harmonic oscillation.  Because of frictional losses that lightly damp the system, the true equation of motion is slightly more complicated; in this experiment the light damping is overcome by a forcing term, namely the constant flow of gas into the system to replace that which is lost.</p> <p>Fortunately, the period of a constant amplitude, forced oscillation is almost negligibly different from the undamped period as long as the damping is light. Forced oscillations are established by drilling a small hole in the side of the tube. This hole allows a small amount of gas to escape when the displacement of the ball is larger than the height of the hole. Hence the motion of the ball interacts with the gas inflow to produce an additional oscillatory force that acts to sustain the oscillation of the ball about an equilibrium position at the location of the hole.</p> <p>Discuss the following in your report</p> <p>Write out the differential equation of motion (i.e., an expression for ), including a term for the frictional losses, and show that it describes a damped oscillator with period  given by</p> <p> </p> <p>Rearranging this equation shows that</p> <p> </p> <p>The parameters , , , and  are easily measurable, and the period  can be measured with a stopwatch.

The number of gas bottles that participate in the oscillation may be varied by controlling the values in the system, so that the volume changes from six flasks all the way down to a single flask. You will likely find it easiest to start with the largest volume, i.e., all six flasks connected, and work your way down to the single flask.</p> <p>First the system must be prepared by flushing out the previous gas that fills the bottles. It is essential that the system be well-flushed out when changing gases-- a minimum of 15 minutes flushing time is recommended. The new gas should be introduced via the pinch-cocks and fine copper tubes. These extend to the bottom of the bottle and the flushing action is likely to be most effective if a heavy gas is used to displace a lighter one.

The former we are not going to cover as it is a field onto itself, but the latter is much more unsterstanable: in short, transistors are effectively little switches, and our ability to make more transistors per unit area has drastically increased since we started making them1, so our ability to build systems capable of logical operations has also increased drastically. This is the story of computational power: better fabrication techquies for transistors means more powerful devices, simply as there are more little pieces of computation inside.</p> <p>A story which runs parallel to the development of computing hardware is software. At the end of the day, programming all of the logical operations required to complete a given task is tough work, and there is no way around having to do this: machine code is the only language that a computer speaks. However, as computaitonal power grows, the amount of power we are willing to dedicate to making our lives easier increases. A good example of this is an old operating system: if you look at early versions of windows, linux, or OS X, they typically look a little janky, laking polish. This isn't because it wasn't possible to do these things, it was because the amount of power required to do those things would mean performance for important tasks would be compromised; however, with a few years passing, one typically has much more computing power to play with, so for accomplishing the same important tasks, one can have a very shiny operating system. The same can be said for coding languages: we now commonly use \"shiny\" languages, which are not the most efficient languages, but are drastically easier to code. For example, <code>python</code> is the language of choice for most scientific applications, and whilst using a lower level language such as <code>C</code> would likely result in a faster computation, when both programs run faster than , the computation time often doesn't matter, and <code>python</code> has all the creature comforts of a high-level language.</p> <p> </p> A microcontroller at home on a PCB <p>We have discussed the construction of computational devices, and the development of cosy coding languages, and it the nexus of these that the user-friendly microcontroller was born.

Before we get to building a dimmer, we need to connect up our Pico to other components, and for this we are going to use a breadboard.</p> Unfamiliar with electronics breadboards? <p>Solderless breadboards, or simply breadboards, are a fantastic tool for prototyping electronics: they allow for a \"plug and play\" approach to building circuits, requiring few leads for connections and fitting almost all standard components. Essentially, breadboards are an array or wire strips, connected in rows but not in columns. This means that to connect up two (or more) components, one must simply plug them into the same row.

Our goal here is to replicate our LED adventure thus far but on an isolated LED rather than the on-board LED, but first, a quick note on LEDs.</p> <p>An LED is a semiconductor component that emits light when current flows through it. Importantly, in addition to emitting light, LEDs - and diodes more generally - only conduct current in one direction: ideally it has zero resistance for current flowing in the forward direction and infinite resistance for current flowing in the reverse direction. It is therefore very important to pay attention to the polarity of an LED: in the wrong orientation, it will not allow current to flow nor will it produce any light. The positive side (anode) of the LED can be readily identied as it has a longer leg.</p> <p>Given that diodes have varying resistance dependent on the direction of current, they clearly do not obey Ohm's law. Rather, diodes require a certain voltage in order to \"turn on\", that is, to allow current to flow, but beyond this the current and voltage are mostly independent. The voltage required for operation is known as the foward voltage () and is typically in the range  depending on the diode material. Even though LEDs are non-Ohmic devices, they emit light with a brightness proportional to the current passing through the diode, just light a globe. And much like a globe, if too much current is passed though the diode, it will be destroyed.

In 1924 Louis de Broglie developed a generalised version of the equations relating the wavelength of light to the momentum of photons, and postulated in his doctoral thesis that particles might also display wave behaviour. de Broglie hypothesised that the inverse proportionality between wavelength and momentum should hold true for all particles; the electron was the lightest known particle at the time, so it was the easiest case for experimenters to test, which Davisson and Germer successfully did in 1928.</p> <p>Electrons accelerated by a high voltage have an associated kinetic energy, which means they have a corresponding linear momentum.  Therefore according to de Broglie's formula we would expect those electrons to have an associated wavelength.  Davisson and Germer tested this hypothesis by placing a suitable diffraction screen in the path of such an electron beam. Diffraction is an interference effect that is fundamental to the propagation of waves, and should be observable for electrons just as with any other wave. However, diffraction gratings developed for optical purposes are totally unsuitable for the demonstration of electron diffraction (briefly explain why in your report), so a quite different experimental set-up must be used.</p> <p>Consider a beam of electrons directed at a phosphorescent target. If the beam is not deflected then it will produce a single bright dot where electrons impact the screen. If a diffusing target is placed in the beamline, then individual electrons will scatter off of atoms in the target, creating a slightly blurred spot on the screen. The atoms in the target are fixed in position, with some regular or irregular spacing depending on the target material. If the electrons always behave as particles, then diffraction cannot occur and the pattern on the screen would resemble a Gaussian distribution. The pattern would change in intensity and width with increasing electron energy based on conservation of momentum applied to each electron-atom collision, but would always have a peak at the unscattered beam position and drop off smoothly with increasing scattering angle.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the electrons can behave as waves, then if the spacing between target atoms is comparable to the wavelength of the electron \"matter waves\", we would expect to see a diffraction pattern caused by interference between electrons scattered from atoms in different layers of the target. According to de Broglie's hypothesis, the electron wavelength is inversely proportional to their momentum, and so the minima and maxima of the diffraction pattern should change in a regular way with electron momentum (and therefore, electron energy, which is directly controlled by the experimenter).</p> <p>For this experiment, graphite has been deposited on a screen as a target. In this form, it is a poly-crystal with micro crystals oriented in many random directions, and we can therefore sample many angles of incidence without needing to vary the direction of the electron beam or the orientation of the target. If the wavelength of the incident light (or particle) is of the order of the separation between the atomic planes in the crystal, the planes will act as a three- dimensional grating.</p> <p>Discuss the following in your report</p> <ul> <li> <p>The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is given by      </p> <p>where  is Planck's constant, p is the particle momentum, and  is the wavelength.  takes the value 6.62610 Js = 4.13610 eVs. What is the predicted wavelength of an electron with kinetic energy K = 3 keV? If a ray of light had this wavelength, in what part of the electromagnetic spectrum would it be?</p> </li> <li> <p>Make an estimate of the spacing between atoms in a piece of graphite. Start by recalling that 12 grams of carbon-12 contain 6.02210 atoms, and the density of graphite is measured to be  = 2.2 gcm. This is only a rough estimate because the packing of individual layers of graphite into a solid varies greatly from sample to sample. State any assumptions you must make to derive your result.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Assuming you have found that the spacing between graphite atoms is of the correct order of magnitude to demonstrate diffraction of an 3 keV electron beam, we can try to predict where we will see intensity maxima in the diffraction pattern, as a function of deflection angle and electron energy.</p> <p>Shown below is a simplified version of diffraction from a crystal lattice. The basic equations for scattering in a crystal were derived by Bragg to describe the interaction of high-energy radiation with matter, and Bragg's Law gives us the means to test de Broglie's hypothesis.</p> <p></p> Diffraction from so-called Bragg planes in a crystalline medium. The heavy solid line in the lower part of the beam path represents the additional path length $\\Delta$s travelled by the electrons in that part of the beam <p>For constructive interference to occur, the path-length difference s travelled by the electrons in one part of the beam relative to the electrons in another part of the beam must be equal to an integer number of de Broglie wavelengths, i.e. s = n. The graphite layers can be treated as a set of discrete layers as in the image above, which shows that the s is related to the spacing of atoms in the crystal lattice, , and the angle of incidence of the electron beam with respect to the surface of the target, . This geometry yields Bragg's Law:</p> <p>  may not be easy to measure (in this case, because the target is held at/near the centre of a sealed, evacuated chamber, but for planar geometry it is simply related to the deflection angle  between the undeviated beam path and the scattered electron path:</p> <p> </p> <p>  can be determined by measuring the linear diameter of a the diffraction ring projected onto a screen combined with knowledge of the dimensions of the TEL-555 diffraction tube apparatus (see Procedure, below). Thus a measure of the diffraction ring diameter is tantamount to a measure of the electron wavelength.</p> <p>For your lab report</p> <p>Relate the electron wavelength to the accelerating voltage in the device by rewriting the de Broglie relation as a function of the charge  and mass  of the electron and the accelerating voltage V. Use the relativistic momentum formula</p> <p> </p> <p>where  is the Lorentz factor from special relativity. Confirm that the electrons in a 5 keV beam are non-relativisitic (i.e.,  1).

Arrange the transmitter and receiver to be equidistant from the wall, one on either side of the sound absorbing screen.  Use whatever simple tests you can devise to satisfy yourself that the receiver is indeed detecting a signal reflected off the wall.</p> <p>Just observing the reflected signal tells you nothing about the travel time of a particular wavefront from transmitter to wall and back, because all wavefronts are identical. Devise a means of measuring the travel time of the leading wave front of a particular burst of ultrasound.  You will need to think carefully about what the trigger controls on the C.R.O. do, and about the significance of the various modes of trigger operation. It may also help to consider the following questions :</p> <ul> <li>Roughly how long, in milliseconds, will it take the first wave front of a burst to travel to the wall and back?</li> <li>During this time, what will the output of the receiver be?</li> <li>How can you trigger a sweep of the C.R.O. at the instant that you start a burst of ultrasound?</li> </ul> <p>You will also need to consider the period of the ultrasound bursts.  Does your next burst from the transmitter occur  before the reflection arrives at the receiver, confusing the temporal association of the transmitted with the reflected burst? Observe the time between your burst of ultrasound and the reflection. Is your prediction of travel time confirmed? You should discuss in your report how you confirmed that the time measurement taken was indeed for the same burst.</p> <p>The transmitter doesn't perform optimally  when it is fed with a chopped sine wave and the amplitude of the sine wave is rather large at around 5V.  Zoom in on the oscilloscope and look at the  ~40 kHz waveform from the Arduino. The reflected signal isn't an exact copy,  something akin to ringing is occurring in the transmitter, in addition to dispersion in the air and by the reflecting surface.</p> <p>Note that a certain amount of ultrasound penetrates through and diffracts around the sound-proof screen, so that the received signal is not zero during the \"off\" periods.

Set it up so that the sound emitted reflects directly back to the receiver. Measure the transit distance using the measuring tape provided. Note that the groove on the transducer tube can be used to ascertain the position of the transducer in the tube. Do not stick measuring tape inside the tube. Measure transit time from the oscilloscope. Repeat the measurements over as wide a range of transmitter-to-wall distances as possible.

The oscilloscope time-base may be inaccurate.  The calibration of time-base speeds around 1 ms. per cm. can be checked by feeding the C.R.O. with a wave of accurately known frequency and comparing its period with the period indicated on the C.R.O. screen. The Rhodes and Schwarz SMX signal generator in Lab 2 is a quality reference instrument. (This error applies more to the old analogue oscilloscopes, rather than the digital models, but worth checking). If a correction is necessary make sure that you get it the right way round; it is easy to make a mistake.</p> <p>Plot transit time versus distance.  (The free R statistical software, or perhaps Python, are to be preferred over Excel, if you wish to become familiar with scientific grade tools)  Use your graph or software to calculate the speed of sound.

In practice one would measure the transit time and calculate the distance using an assumed speed of sound, but we are concerned with variations in the speed.)</p> <p>Remember to note estimates of distance and time measurement errors, as well as temperature and  humidity error.

The lifetime of the muon Particle physics Muons are naturally occurring subatomic particles that originate from the interaction between cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei. In this experiment muons are captured into an absorber, and then the rate of muon radioactive decay is measured using a scintillation detector. From the rate of decays, the half-life of the muon can be determined. Microwave waveguides Electromagnetism The aim of this experiment is to measure the characteristics of a section of waveguide and subsequently examine the reflection, transmission and adsorption due to an obstacle placed in the guide. Nuclear magnetic resonance Atomic physics, quantum mechanics Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool in modern healthcare. This experiment examines the underlying physics, allowing students to investigate the magnetic field characteristics required, and measure the spin relaxation times of a sample (mineral oil). The production and characterisation of X-rays Atomic physics Atoms bombarded by electrons with energies on the order of 10-100 keV are observed to produce X-rays by the Bremsstrahlung mechanism, and also through ionization from inner shell energy levels. In this experiment a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube is used to detect the characteristic X-rays produced by a copper sample. Scattering these X-rays through a lithium fluoride crystal allows the student to measure the energy dispersion of these X-rays. Scattering of  radiation Nuclear physics Students test the angular dependence of scattering for gold, silver and aluminium foil. They may also measure the energy distribution of pulses from the silicon semiconductor detector in order to investigate the source spectrum and energy resolution of the detector. The experiment provides an introduction to the techniques of energy measurement for fast charged particles, the use of pulse height analysis and vacuum systems. It also increases awareness of statistical problems associated with nuclear measurements. Solar spectroscopy Astrophysics, optics Students obtain digital Solar spectra through the whole visual region and use these to identify all strong lines and their species, together with undertaking a particular study of the violet resonance lines of ionized calcium to estimate the calcium abundance in the Sun. The Zeeman effect in Mercury Atomic physics, optics, quantum mechanics The anomalous Zeeman splitting of the green line of mercury is observed using a Fabry-Perot Interferometer. The value of the Bohr magneton is obtained and the polarization of the line is studied. The experiment complements the lectures on the Zeeman effect and gives experience in the measurement of magnetic fields and in high-resolution spectroscopy.

Increasingly, scientists subscribe to services that email a list of abstracts in their field, a dozen or more per day. The abstract is your only chance of catching the attention of the people you want to read your report. If your abstract is not concise and to the point, then no one will read the report. It should contain a few words (normally less than about 50) outlining what has been done, what is new or interesting about the method you have used, the results and conclusions.

From the marking point of view, there is no point in copying out a slab of theory verbatim from the experiment notes. In this case you should summarise the notes in your own words, in a manner that makes it clear that you understand the process. In any case, you should refer to this handbook, giving page numbers and equation numbers where relevant, and the major steps in the theory should be written up.

The reader will not be interested in the fine details of the calculation, but will assume that they have been done with care, and will assume that the error calculations have been done correctly. Hence calculations will normally be omitted from a research report unless there is something interesting or unusual to which the author wishes to draw attention.

One solution is to create a text editor which renders text into a better format in real time, such as Microsoft Word, but as anyone who has spent any time with Word, it has limitations when it comes to usability and formatting. In the world of science, especially when it comes to publishing, it is much more convenient to use tools such as markdown or  which allow the user to write pseudo-code, where content is written in an editor, and then compiled prior to consumption, where the compiler renders the text, images, and other objects (e.g. code, tables, etc.) to make everything look pretty. The answer to the question \"how do I markdown\" is thus write pseudo code in an editor of your choice and then compile it. Which editor should you use? Well, free and open-source editors exist online and these can be great for getting a start, or you can write markdown in Jupyter as described elsewhere.</p>"},{"location":"reference/markdown/#this-page","title":"This page","text":"<p>This page has a sole purpose: to serve as a reference page for common markdown functions.</p>"},{"location":"reference/markdown/#markdown-cheat-sheet","title":"Markdown cheat sheet","text":"<p>The cheat sheet is best viewed on this site, as it shows both the markdown code and rendered outcome, but you can also access the raw markdown or pure rendered form of this cheat sheet on GitHub, or access a Jupyter notebook of the markdown to experiment yourself.</p>"},{"location":"reference/markdown/#markdown-cheat-sheet_1","title":"Markdown cheat sheet","text":""},{"location":"reference/markdown/#formatting","title":"Formatting","text":""},{"location":"reference/markdown/#headings","title":"Headings","text":"<p>Headings are made using the <code>#</code> symbol.
