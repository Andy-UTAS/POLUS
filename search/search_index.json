In short: as part of a physics major, you must complete 3 experiments and complete all assessments . Semester one, 2023 Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your second-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at physical phenomena and hone your ability to employ the scientific method. Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook. All information for the lab program is hosted on the lab website , including the available experiments (and associated documentation), reference material for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more. The part II labs are co-ordinated by the subject coordinator, and all enquiries should be directed to the physics lab mailbox Overview \u00b6 Working in pairs, you will complete three experiments for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and additionally, at the end of the semester you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from the semester; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation. Schedule \u00b6 Labs will run in three two blocks of 3 weeks. The dates for semester one, 2023 are as follows: Experiment block one: weeks 2, 3, and 4, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment Experiment block two: weeks 5, 6, and 7, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment Experiment block three: weeks 8, 9, and 10, with logbooks to be submitted to the relevant dropbox by the end of the day following your experiment A final block is to be dedicated to scientific communication: Week 11: report preparation, with submission for peer assessment by the end of Friday, September 29th Week 12: Peer assessment and editing, with peer assessment feedback due by the end of Wednesday, October 4th, and submission of your final report by the end of Sunday, October 8th Week 13: Lab report presentations, Monday October 9th and Wednesday October 11th Assessment Assessment will primarily be performed through the development and submission of logbooks, which you will build over the course of each 3-week experiment to detail your methodology, results, discussion and general thoughts. In addition to the material on the website, you can discuss how to approach writing and structuring your experimental logbook with your demonstrator. Combined with the final session presentation, weighting for assessments are: Experiment one (25%) Experiment two (25%) Experiment three (25%) Scientific communication: report (15%), presentation (5%), and peer assessment (5%) Experiments \u00b6 Over the course of the two subjects, it is expected that you will complete seven experiments. It is suggested that you pick experiments which interest you, but also across of range of subjects to ensure exposure to diverse content. KYA211: waves and kinetic theory KYA212: electromagnetism and thermodynamics KYA---: under development Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary Difficulty Adiabatic index of gasses Kinetic theory The period of a ball bearing undergoing lightly-damped, forced oscillations due to pressure variations in a gas reservoir is observed as a way to evaluate the adiabatic index \\gamma of the gas. \\gamma is a fundamental thermodynamic property of gases that according to theory must take values equal to the ratio of two integers for mono-, di-, and tri-atomic gases. Argon, dry air (O _2 + N _2 ), and CO _2 are used as examples of the three types. \\gamma is related to the compressibility, the sound speed, and the heat capacity of a gas. Electron diffraction Wave mechanics, Quantum physics A thin piece of highly-ordered material is considered as a diffraction screen with aperture spacings determined by the atomic spacings in the sample. Observations of the patterns that result when electrons accelerated through several kilovolts hit a chip of graphite can be used to prove that electrons can exhibit wave behaviour in accordance with deBroglie's hypothesis, and to probe the spacing and arrangement of graphite atoms on scales \\lesssim 10 ^{-9} m. Time-domain reflectometry Wave mechanics, Electromagnetism The properties of waveforms travelling through cables with different characteristic impedances are investigated. The behaviour of reflected waves from boundaries of high, low, and matched impedance is observed and related to the wave equation, and the characteristic impedance and speed of pulses in a cable are used to compare the cable inductance and capacitance to theoretically calculated values. Ultrasonic ranging Wave mechanics This experiment looks into some of the problems involved in using ultrasonic sound waves to measure the distance of an object from an ultrasonic transmitter. Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary Difficulty Charge-to-mass ration of the electron Electromagnetism This experiment uses a kinematic analysis of the helical path followed by electrons deflected by a magnetic field to determine the ratio of the electric charge e to the mass m_e . The ratio is determined by measuring the change in magnetic field required to keep an electron beam focused on a CRT screen as a function of different accelerating voltages (also known as Hoag's method). Entropy change in a rubber band Thermal physics The relation between work, temperature, and entropy is explored by testing the amount of work required to stretch a rubber band at different temperatures. Hysteresis of iron Electromagnetism Hysteresis in a physical system arises when the internal state of the system depends on the past history of external forces applied, i.e., the system does not return to its lowest-energy or equilibrium state in the absence of an applied force. This happens during the magnetisation of ferromagnetic material in an external field. In this experiment magnetic hysteresis in iron is explored as a function of the size of the magnetising current, and the energy dissipation due to hysteresis losses is explored. Induction and the Earth's magnetic field Electromagnetism A changing magnetic flux creates a measurable electric current in a loop of wire. One way of creating a change in magnetic flux is by changing the orientation of a coil with respect to a constant magnetic field \\mathbf{B} . In this experiment, the strength and orientation of the Earth's magnetic field is measured by observing the electrical response produced during a 180^{\\circ} rotation of a coil of wire (colloquially known as the \\pi -flipper ). The Michelson interferometer Wave mechanics, optics The wave nature of light at visible wavelengths is demonstrated by use of a dual-beam interferometer of the sort pioneered by Michelson. By altering the optical path length of one beam relative to the other, interference effects are used to measure the index of refraction of mica and of air over a range of pressures. Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary Difficulty Fourier optics Wave mechanics, Optics The Frank-Hertz experiment Quantum mechanics The Mach-Zehnder interferometer Wave mechanics, Optics Holography Wave mechanics, Optics Prior to performing any experiments, it is a requirement that you have completed the lab induction . Assessment \u00b6 As part of each experiment, you will be expected to maintain an experimental logbook upon which you will be assessed. Log books are to be written during practical sessions, with the expectation that the vast majority - ideally the entirety - of the work will be completed during the allocated classes. Reports are required to be submitted by 1300 the day after your final lab session for a given experiment. Your logbook will be returned prior to your next experiment, and part of your assessment will be based upon how you address your markers comments. In addition to your logbook, once per semester you will be required to select one of the completed experiments and prepare a formal report and to give a short group presentation. Information on how to prepare, and what is expected for a log, a report and a presentation can be found in the reference section of POLUS .

The behaviour of reflected waves from boundaries of high, low, and matched impedance is observed and related to the wave equation, and the characteristic impedance and speed of pulses in a cable are used to compare the cable inductance and capacitance to theoretically calculated values. Introduction \u00b6 Objectives \u00b6 To observe and record the waveforms associated with reflections off of barriers with varying characteristic impedances. To study the effect of matched impedance on pulse reflections. To compare the characteristic inductance and capacitance of the cables derived from measurements of the pulse speed and impedance to the theoretically predicted values. Equipment \u00b6 Signal generator, oscilloscope (digital or analogue), potentiometer (three-terminal voltage divider), coaxial cable, twisted pair wire, multimeter, and leads with connectors to allow for short and open circuit terminations. The lengths of the cables is written on the cable spools (between 40 and \\approx 300 m) and may be assumed to be accurate to \\pm0.1 m; the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cable can be obtained from the cable specifications, and the impedances of the oscilloscope and signal generator will be found on the equipment or in the relevant manuals. Principal Data Taken \u00b6 Graph or photograph of the incident and any reflected pulses for both the short circuit and open circuit cases, for the coaxial cable and the twisted pair wire. Velocity of the pulses in both test cables. Characteristic impedance Z _0 of the twisted pair wire and coaxial cable. Things to Watch Out For \u00b6 The TDR setups on different benches have slightly different coaxial cables and twisted pair test wires, which may have very different characteristic impedances, lengths, and physical constructions (e.g., a single pair of conductors vs. a double pair in parallel). Make sure you include the labels of the cables used in your report. Check with your demonstrator to see if the cables you are using have the properties you think they do There may be multiple reflected pulses in the system, some with very low amplitudes; search the oscilloscope trace carefully and relate observed features to physical boundaries in the system to make sure you understand the paths the signal may be taking. Theoretical Background \u00b6 An electromagnetic signal in a wire is a form of wave, with its propagation speed and dispersive properties determined by the medium in which the wave travels. For a wire, these properties are typically summarised by a few related measurable properties: the characteristic impedance Z _0 , the inductance per unit length ( L^{\\prime} ) and the capacitance per unit length ( C^{\\prime} ); these are determined by the geometry and dielectric properties of the wire and any associated shielding. In general when a signal crosses from one wire to another, or encounters a junction, device, or break in the wire, a reflected pulse is generated because the signal \"sees\" the change in medium as an increase or decrease in Z_0 . In the ideal case, when no energy is lost to dissipative effects, the expression relating the incident and reflected pulse voltage is \\label{eqn:vrefl} \\frac{V_r}{V_i} = \\frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}, where V_i and V_r are the incident and reflected voltages respectively, and Z_L is the load impedance (impedance of the barrier, device or new wire). Clearly the voltage of the reflected pulse can be very high, near zero, or even negative, depending on the relationship between Z_0 and Z_L . The above equation can be transformed into the equivalent equation for the current using Ohm's law. Similar expressions can be obtained for any wave, for example acoustic waves in the Earth encountering different rock layers, or ocean waves travelling across the boundary of the continental shelf. A transmission line with two conductors like a coaxial or twisted pair cable can be modelled in circuit theory as a long \"ladder\" formed by two wires with some series inductive impedance per unit length along the two wires and some parallel capacitive impedance per unit length across the \"rungs\" of the ladder. This formulation leads to a description of the change in voltage and current with distance along the transmission line ( \\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}x and \\mathrm{d}I/\\mathrm{d}x ), the solution of which yields a wave equation in V (and in I ). For a single wave solution in one direction, the solution of the wave equation with the characteristic impedance Z_0 eventually gives: \\label{eqn:zchar} Z_0 = \\frac{V}{I} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{C^{\\prime}}}. In a lossless transmission line whose length is much shorter than the wavelength of the signal, the inductance per unit length L^{\\prime} can be determined from the definition of inductive reactance and the relationship between frequency, wavelength and wave velocity v 1 . For the purposes of this lab, the result of greatest interest is: \\label{eqn:lchar} L^{\\prime} = \\frac{Z_0}{v} The above equations can be combined to derive a similar expression relating C^{\\prime} to v and Z_0 and thus it is possible to determine C ^{\\prime} and L ^{\\prime} from measurements of the pulse v and Z_0 . C^{\\prime} and L^{\\prime} are ultimately determined by the construction of the transmission line. A coaxial cable consists a solid conducting cylinder separated from a hollow cylindrical conductor by a dielectric material as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:coaxial}. For inner and outer radii a and b respectively, the properties of the cable are given by: \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:coaxial} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{2\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\ln\\left(b/a\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\ln\\left(b/a\\right) \\end{eqnarray} where \\kappa is the dielectric constant of the insulator and \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0 are the permittivity and permeability of free space, with their usual values. Because the twisted-pair wire has a different geometry, the transmission properties are quite different, and are given by \\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eqn:twisted1} C^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\pi\\kappa\\epsilon_0}{\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right)} \\\\ L^{\\prime} & = & \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\pi}\\cosh^{-1}\\left(s/2r\\right) \\label{eqn:twisted2} \\end{eqnarray} In this case the two wires have radius r and are separated by a fixed thickness s of insulating material, as seen in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\cosh^{-1} is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, which may not be available on a typical hand calculator but is defined in most spreadsheet programs and mathematical packages such as Mathematica or Matlab. In transmission lines comprising multiple pairs in parallel, the formula must be modified using the rules for combining impedances in parallel. This may become important depending on which twisted-pair wire you are using\\footnote{The burglar alarm wire comprises two pairs of twisted strands, which are combined in parallel by the connectors at the cable ends. In Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}, imagine a second pair oriented 90 ^{\\circ} away from from the wires shown.}. \\noindent\\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth} Cable cross-sections Coaxial cable Twisted-pair cable Procedure \u00b6 Start by connecting the signal generator to the oscilloscope through the T-junction. You will test two types of transmission lines by connecting them to the other side of the T-junction: first a twisted-pair wire (at one of the benches this is a telephone wire, and on the other it is a burglar alarm wire), and then a coaxial cable . Both the coaxial and twisted-pair lines have been prepared with connectors on the end so that you can easily use them in the short circuit (low terminating impedance) and open circuit (high terminating impedance) conditions. Set the signal generator to a single pulse of narrow width. The required cycle time will depend on the cable length. Set up the signal generator and the oscilloscope so that you can see just a few of the pulses on the screen. The first of these will be the generated pulse. When you have the time baseline correctly adjusted, the other pulses will be reflected ones. Ask your demonstrator for assistance if you are having trouble setting up the apparatus or observing the pulses. \\begin{enumerate} Examine the waveforms on the twisted-pair line in both the short circuit (ends of the leads connected) and open circuit (ends disconnected) conditions. Try to associate each feature in the diagram with a physical interaction between the pulse and a component of the apparatus. Sketch or photograph the pulses and label them accordingly. In some cases there may be multiple pulses observed; search carefully for low-amplitude features, and think carefully about their origin. Note that the x -axis of your graph should have the coordinates of time (microseconds \\mu s or nanoseconds ns). In your report, explain qualitatively why the series of pulses decreases in amplitude, as well as the reason for the polarity of every pulse observed. Calculate the speed of the pulses along the line by comparing the time coordinates of the initial and reflected pulses. Express this answer both in m~s ^{-1} and as a fraction of the speed of light. Think carefully about the sources of uncertainty that creep into your result, and include these factors in your reported error. Connect the potentiometer to the end of the wire to use it as a variable impedance termination. Find the characteristic impedance Z _0 of the twisted-pair wire in accordance with Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} as follows: change Z _L by turning the dial on the potentiometer. When the amplitude of the reflected pulse drops to zero, the impedance of the potentiometer is matched to the line impedance. Z _L can be measured with a multimeter. In your report, explain carefully how you determined the condition of minimal reflection and how you determined the uncertainty in your estimate of Z _0 . Repeat the experiment using the coaxial cable (omitting the determination of Z _0 since the coaxial cable is well-standardised at Z _0 = 50~ \\Omega ). Describe any differences in the oscilloscope trace between the twisted-pair and the coaxial cases, and account for them referring to Equation~\\ref{eqn:vrefl} and the impedances of the signal generator and oscilloscope. \\end{enumerate} Calculations \u00b6 You have experimentally measured the pulse velocity v and the characteristic impedance Z _0 for two types of transmission line. With these data you can calculate the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the lines, and compare those to the theoretical predictions for the two types of line. In this experiment, the length of the transmission line is known and the reflectometry is used to determine the pulse velocity, but in a real field situation we may have the opposite case, in which the velocity is known. In this case the pulse timing can tell you the distance between the signal generator and a change in impedance such as a break in the line (as well as the nature of the break in the line). Do the following calculations for both cables tested: \\begin{enumerate} 1. Use v and Z _0 to find L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} for the transmission line (Equations~\\ref{eqn:zchar} and \\ref{eqn:lchar}). It may be useful to remember that the units for L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} are henries per metre (H \\cdot m ^{-1} ) and farads per metre (F \\cdot m ^{-1} ), respectively. The SI unit prefixes for 10 ^{-12} , 10 ^{-9} , and 10 ^{-6} are pico-, nano-, and micro-, respectively. Using the cable specifications, look up the characteristic impedence of the coaxial cable. Does the value agree with your measurement? Consider the formulae for theoretical calculation of L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} (Equations~\\ref{eqn:coaxial}--\\ref{eqn:twisted2}). Using the appropriate values for the two wires, find the expected L ^{\\prime} and C ^{\\prime} of both transmission lines. Do your empirically determined values agree with the theory? If not, discuss some possible reasons for the disagreement. The transmission line properties for some of the cables are as follows. {\\bf Don't forget to specify in the report labels of the cables used.} \\begin{itemize} * {\\bf Coaxial cable:} $\\kappa$ = 2.3$\\pm$0.1(high-density polyethylene); inner diameter $a$ = 0.90 $\\pm$0.05~mm; outer diameter $b$ = 3.80 $\\pm$0.05~mm. * {\\bf Telephone wire:} $\\kappa$ = 2.3$\\pm$0.1; wire diameter 2$r$ = 0.52 $\\pm$0.02~mm; pair separation $s$ = 0.90 $\\pm$0.05~mm. * {\\bf Burglar alarm wire:} $\\kappa$ = 4.3$\\pm$0.1 (PVC); wire diameter 2$r$ = 0.54 $\\pm$0.02~mm; pair separation $s$ = 1.05$\\pm$0.05~mm; Note in your calculations that there are two pairs of cables, connected in parallel. \\end{itemize} \\end{enumerate} Bonus Section \u00b6 For a couple of extra marks, derive Equations~\\ref{eqn:twisted1} and \\ref{eqn:twisted2} using the definitions of capacitance and inductance together with the geometry in Figure~\\ref{fig:twisted}. \\vspace{18pt} \\noindent{\\bf References}\\ \\noindent Dickey, J. 2018, {\\it Lecture Notes for KYA211/374}, available on MyLO\\ \\noindent Pain, H.J. 2005, {\\it The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, 6th Ed.}, (Wiley: London)\\ \\noindent Terman, F. 1955, {\\it Electronic and Radio Engineering, 4th Ed.}, (McGraw-Hill: New York) C.

Argon, dry air (O _2 + N _2 ), and CO _2 are used as examples of the three types. \\gamma is related to the compressibility, the sound speed, and the heat capacity of a gas. Introduction \u00b6 Objectives \u00b6 To verify that the frequency of oscillation of a pressurised gas system varies according to whether the gas is monoatomic, diatomic, or triatomic. To use kinetic theory calculations to measure the adiabatic index \\gamma of argon, air, and CO _2 from oscillation timing data. To see how repeated measurements of a quantity reduce the standard error of the mean measured value. Equipment \u00b6 Gas cylinders and air compressor; \"Ruchhardt apparatus\" for measuring adiabatic oscillations of a ball bearing (6 glass bottles connected by a manifold to a vertical tube in which the oscillations may be observed); stopwatches; grey notebook with experimental notes and details. The masses and dimensions of the equipment that you will need in order to evaluate your timing data are given below . Principal Data Taken \u00b6 Mean period of oscillation of the system for 3 different gases. For each gas, 6 different volumes are tested, and the relationship between period and system volume yields an estimate of \\gamma . The atmospheric pressure P_0 . The adiabatic index you derive will depend inversely on the pressure in the system. There is a mercury barometer at the front of the room to make this measurement.

The inflow is regulated by a pressure reduction valve on the cylinder and a bleed-cock valve on the Ruchhardt manifold. The gas flow should be kept low and adjusted carefully since high flow rates will cause the ball bearing to be ejected from the apparatus, possibly damaging the lights, the ceiling, or the students. CO _2 has a very strong deviation from ideal gas behaviour that causes it to cool upon expansion. This strong cooling can make the valve on the cylinder's pressure regulator ice up and flutter, giving irregular flow and making it impossible to measure the oscillations accurately. Use the smallest possible flow rate of CO _2 to avoid this. Make sure you understand the operation of the gate valves and capillary tubes connecting the flasks to the manifold. It is essential that the valves are properly set to first allow the flushing of the system, and then to allow a fixed volume of gas to be maintained during the experiment. Theoretical Background \u00b6 The specific heat of a gas depends on whether the gas is heated under conditions of constant pressure or of constant volume. These two parameters are defined by the equations C_V = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\frac{dQ}{dT}\\right)_V is the specific heat at constant volume and C_P = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\frac{dQ}{dT}\\right)_P is the specific heat at constant pressure where dQ is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of mass m of the gas by an amount dT 1 2 . The ratio of specific heats gives rise to the important physical parameter \\gamma : \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} \\gamma is known as the adiabatic index of a gas. For many gases it is constant over a wide range of conditions. For ideal gases \\gamma can only take certain discrete values depending on the molecular structure of the gas. Kinetic theory considerations give \\begin{eqnarray*} \\gamma_{monatomic} & = 5/3 & = 1.67\\\\ \\gamma_{diatomic} & = 7/5 & = 1.40\\\\ \\gamma_{triatomic} & = 8/6 & = 1.33 \\end{eqnarray*} The object of this experiment is to estimate the value of \\gamma for various gases employing the method first used by Ruchhardt in 1929 3 . Ruchhardt used the kinetic theory of gases to derive a relationship between \\gamma and the oscillation period of a system using only simple mechanical calculations and no thermodynamics. The starting point for the analysis is the fact that for a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic transformation 4 5 , PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} where P is the pressure and V is the volume. This is known as the adiabatic equation for a perfect gas and can be contrasted with the more familiar case for an isothermal expansion or compression, PV = \\mathrm{constant} . When the ball is in equilibrium, the pressure in the system P = P_0 + \\frac{mg}{A} where m is the mass of the ball, g is the acceleration due to gravity, A is the cross-sectional area of the ball, and P _0 is the atmospheric pressure. The overpressure in the system supports the ball and prevents it from falling to the bottom of the tube (in reality there is some leakage from the system and the pressure decreases over time). In Ruchhardt's experiment, a metal ball is free to move up and down within a vertical glass tube connected to a flask filled with the gas for which \\gamma is to be measured. It is assumed that frictional losses are small and that the amount of gas escaping past the ball is negligible compared to the volume of the system. As the ball oscillates, the pressure in the system changes by a small amount \\pm dP. As the ball is displaced a distance y from equilibrium the volume and pressure change by \\begin{eqnarray*} dV & = & yA\\\\ dP & = & F/A \\end{eqnarray*} where F is the restoring force acting on the ball. As long as the displacement occurs on a timescale that is small compared to the characteristic time for heat flow into and out of the gas, the condition for adiabatic compression/expansion is nearly satisfied, and $PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} applies. We can differentiate this relationship \\gamma P V^{\\gamma-1}dV + V^{\\gamma}dP = 0 and connect the adiabatic equation to the displacement relationships by substituting in for dP and dV from above: F = -\\frac{\\gamma P A^2}{V}y . This is the equation for a force acting on the ball that is linearly proportional to the displacement y and directed towards the equilibrium position. The corresponding equation of motion describes a system undergoing simple harmonic oscillation. Because of frictional losses that lightly damp the system, the true equation of motion is slightly more complicated; in this experiment the light damping is overcome by a forcing term, namely the constant flow of gas into the system to replace that which is lost. Fortunately, the period of a constant amplitude, forced oscillation is almost negligibly different from the undamped period as long as the damping is light. Forced oscillations are established by drilling a small hole in the side of the tube. This hole allows a small amount of gas to escape when the displacement of the ball is larger than the height of the hole. Hence the motion of the ball interacts with the gas inflow to produce an additional oscillatory force that acts to sustain the oscillation of the ball about an equilibrium position at the location of the hole. Discuss the following in your report Write out the differential equation of motion (i.e., an expression for \\ddot{y} ), including a term for the frictional losses, and show that it describes a damped oscillator with period T given by \\label{eqn:period} T \\approx 2\\pi\\left(\\frac{mV}{\\gamma PA^2}\\right)^{1/2} Rearranging this equation shows that \\gamma = \\frac{4\\pi ^2mV}{A^2PT^2} The parameters A , m , V , and P are easily measurable, and the period T can be measured with a stopwatch. A look at the rules for propagation of error can help you estimate the precision with which you need to measure T in order to distinguish between possible values of \\gamma (1.40, 1.33, etc.). Procedure \u00b6 From the theoretical background, you have found a relationship between the oscillation period and adiabatic index in a gas system that depends on the volume. By measuring the period at a succession of different volumes, an accurate estimate of \\gamma may be obtained. In this experiment you will measure the oscillation periods at six different values of the system volume. The number of gas bottles that participate in the oscillation may be varied by controlling the values in the system, so that the volume changes from six flasks all the way down to a single flask. You will likely find it easiest to start with the largest volume, i.e., all six flasks connected, and work your way down to the single flask. First the system must be prepared by flushing out the previous gas that fills the bottles. It is essential that the system be well-flushed out when changing gases-- a minimum of 15 minutes flushing time is recommended. The new gas should be introduced via the pinch-cocks and fine copper tubes. These extend to the bottom of the bottle and the flushing action is likely to be most effective if a heavy gas is used to displace a lighter one. Hence you should make your measurements first with air, then with argon, and finally with CO _2 . Detailed instructions (and diagrams) may be found in the grey notebook on the lab bench nearest the Ruchhardt apparatus. If necessary, start the oscillations by briefly holding your thumb over the top of the glass tube. This will cause the pressure to build up and slightly compress the air inside the flasks, overcoming the internal friction in the system. The gas pressure should be adjusted very carefully using the stopcock so that the ball oscillates with constant amplitude. Repeat the measurements for each of the possible values of V, and each of the gases. You will find it useful to time multiple periods of the oscillation in order to minimise the random uncertainties in the results. Calculations \u00b6 Use the method of least squares to plot the relationship between period and volume. Is there any indication of a departure from the expected period T as derived? If yes, suggest possible reasons. Use the parameters from your equation of the line of best fit to calculate the value of \\gamma and the standard error \\sigma_{\\gamma} from your data.

If significant differences are found, consider the theoretical background and experimental apparatus to suggest possible sources of systematic error.

Ruchhardt used the kinetic theory of gases to derive a relationship between \\gamma and the oscillation period of a system using only simple mechanical calculations and no thermodynamics. The starting point for the analysis is the fact that for a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic transformation 4 5 , PV^{\\gamma} = \\mathrm{constant} where P is the pressure and V is the volume.

It is therefore worthwhile that we spend some time to appreciate how is it exactly that these devices function? What are the basic building blocks which allow for the construction of all manner of wonderous widgets? Objectives and learning outcomes Obtain familiarity with the basic concepts of digital systems Use a microcontroller to \"read\" and \"write\" states of electronic components via software Introduction \u00b6 Famously, the Apollo Guidance Computer - the computer that allowed humans to walk on the moon - is significantly less powerful than the computational power of even the most basic of mobile phones. But what does that actually mean? And from where does this power come from? To gain an appreciation of the \"power\" of a computer is really hard, as humans are terribile at conceptualising things which are not linear, so when one is hit the numbers such as The first intel processor had 2250 transistors At the time of writing, the most powerful intel processor has 4.4 \\times 10^9 transistors the fact that the transistor count - and as we shall see, the number of calculations - is a million times greater doesn't register as mind blowing, when it really should. Backgound \u00b6 Early experiments and systems which manipulated electric and magnetic fields are inherently analogue . The basic analogue components come in three flavours: Resistance Capacitance Inductance Exerscise 1 Explain the physics origins of each of the above electromagnetic properties of materials Mordern electronics rely largely on digital systems, which in contrast to their analogue sibling, are much simpler, and are inherently ready to be connected together to make complex systems. We are not going to go too far into the weeds of how exactly one builds a machine for computation, but we are going to have a bit of a glance. Logic \u00b6 Digital systems have two states: and on state, and an off state. It should then come as no surprise that the most basic building block of a digital system is a switch, which is either on or off . The magic starts to happen when we intoduce logic, namely devices which take input values and transform them to a single output value. A simple example of a logic gate is one constructed in a circuit as shown below: each of the two switches can either be open ( off ) or closed ( on ), but only when both switches are closed will the light be illuminated. An AND gate as depicted using switches in a circuit: only when both switches are closed will the light illuminate. To represent these structures mathematically, we can use truth tables, which adopt the convention of the off state being represented by 0 and the on state being depiced by 1 and display all states of the system. The truth table for the system as depicted above (an AND gate) is: A B Output 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 Exercise 2 Make the truth table for the following system: and have a guess the name of this logic operator. We are not going to go through all the possible ways that one might construct logic gates, but hopefully you can see how one might be able to chart a path to other logic gates, along with sequences of logic gates which can start to permit simple operations, from which we can execute further operations. If you are interested in delving into this, along with additional topics such as how to store digital information, an excellent video series is thoroughly recommended, along with a digital logic simulator . Microcontrollers \u00b6 We have just seen that a collection of switches allows us to create logic gates. The secret sauces which have let computation grow into the juggernaut that we know it to be are (information theory)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory] and transistors. The former we are not going to cover as it is a field onto itself, but the latter is much more unsterstanable: in short, transistors are effectively little switches, and our ability to make more transistors per unit area has drastically increased since we started making them 1 , so our ability to build systems capable of logical operations has also increased drastically. This is the story of computational power: better fabrication techquies for transistors means more powerful devices, simply as there are more little pieces of computation inside. A story which runs parallel to the development of computing hardware is software. At the end of the day, programming all of the logical operations required to complete a given task is tough work, and there is no way around having to do this: machine code is the only language that a computer speaks. However, as computaitonal power grows, the amount of power we are willing to dedicate to making our lives easier increases. A good example of this is an old operating system: if you look at early versions of windows, linux, or OS X, they typically look a little janky, laking polish. This isn't because it wasn't possible to do these things, it was because the amount of power required to do those things would mean performance for important tasks would be compromised; however, with a few years passing, one typically has much more computing power to play with, so for accomplishing the same important tasks, one can have a very shiny operating system. The same can be said for coding languages: we now commonly use \"shiny\" languages, which are not the most efficient languages, but are drastically easier to code. For example, python is the language of choice for most scientific applications, and whilst using a lower level language such as C would likely result in a faster computation, when both programs run faster than 100~\\textrm{ms} , the computation time often doesn't matter, and python has all the creature comforts of a high-level language. A microcontroller at home on a PCB We have discussed the construction of computational devices, and the development of cosy coding languages, and it the nexus of these that the user-friendly microcontroller was born. Microcontrollers are collections of logic gates which can be controlled to perform specific operations; however, programming them was not always easy. Moreover, When it came to deciding which microcontoller to use, there were many considerations (and hence a large number of microcontrollers in the wild). Delightfully, there has been somewhat of a revolution in the last decade with mass-produced, low-cost, and highly-accessible - easily coded - microcontollers being brought to market. It is here that we have our jumping off point: microcontollers (little computers) that we can easily control (using code) to control and measure all manner of things - which is a cornerstone of experimental physics. Apparatus \u00b6 The nature of this digital systems tutorial means that we will be performing a number of bite-sized experiments, and as such the apparatus will need to be reconfigured for each experiment; however, at the core of all experiments are two common elements. These are a microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico , and the coding enviroment we shall use to program the microcontroller: Thonny . The Raspberry Pi Pico \u00b6 The two most common microcontrollers are the Arduino 2 and the Raspberry Pi Pico . In the case of the latter, these should not be confused with the Raspberry Pi SBC which are produced by the same company, but are very differnt products. Why the Raspberry Pi Pico? Given the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi Pico are both commonplace, why choose one over the other? The reasons we use the Pico are It can be programmed using Python 3 It has a convenient form factor A Raspberry Pi Pico board, with the RP2040 microcontroller visible in the centre of the board The Raspberry Pi Pico is a board based around the RP2040 microcontroller, which we are going to program the get information both to and from experiments. How do I make it go? The following experiments are going to cover the basics of using a Raspberry Pi Pico, but there are no shortage of excellent introductions which can be found elsewhere, for example, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has a guide to Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico . Thonny \u00b6 We have our hardware, but now we need to talk to it and for better and worse, the only language it speaks is code. In order to program our Pico, we are going to use a MicroPython , which walks and talks like the Python language, only it is pared back: ordinary Python is designed to run on big computers whilst MicroPython is designed to run on little computers, i.e. microcontrollers. To write our programs and transfer them to the Pico, were are going to use Thonny - a barebones Python IDE . Help, I don't know coding! This tutorial does not assume that you know coding. We are going to do some coding, but as you will come to see, learning to often code involves looking at functional code, and bending it to your will through experimentation and experience. You can find some resources on this site the providing both some background and explicit detail ; however, this page is designed to be self-contained, so take a deep breath, and let's go! Experiments \u00b6 The nature of this digital systems tutorial means that we will be performing bite-sized experiments, which will involve both building a circuit and coding the Pico. Hopefully this taster will prime you to realise how powerful these devices are and how you might harness them during you physics studies, but also futher afield. \"Hello, World!\" \u00b6 The very first task one usually performs when setting out on a new coding adventure is to let the world know that you are alive. The microcontroller equivalent of saying \"Hello, World!\" is blinking an LED , so that is what we are going to do. Connect the Pico to a lab computer with a USB cable and open Thonny, and verify the program has connected to the Pico by checking the Shell tab in Thonny looks as shown below: Help! Thonny does not look like the image above If Thonny is not connecting to your Raspberry Pi Pico, there are a few common causes for this, which can be rectified by trying the following in order: Verify that the USB cable is properly connected to both the computer and the Raspberry Pi Pico board Flash the MicroPython firmware to the Pico, which is done following these instructions Restart Thonny If Thonny still does not connect to your Pico, consult with your demonstrator. Remaining in the Shell tab, type the following lines: from machine import Pin led = Pin ( 25 , Pin . OUT ) If you are unframiliar with code, this may all look a bit strange, but we are going to break it down. The first line imports the Pin class from the machine module, meaning that there is a bunch of code hidden in the background relating to controlling input and output pins of the Pico, but we get to use much more understandable code to actually make it go. Explicitly, this takes the form of the second line where we make an object, and it so happens that pin number 25 on the Pico is connected to an LED that is on-board, and we want to have this pin have current flow (or not), turning on (or off) the LED , so we telling the microcontroller Create an object, call it \"led\", and have this be linked to an output on pin number 25. With this done, we can now execute the function: led . toggle () Exerscise 3 What do you think will happen if you execute the above line of code again? Do it, and find out. Blinky Bill \u00b6 Hopefully you found some joy in making the on-board LED blink, but imagine that you had to have the LED blink on and off at set intervals, and you didn't want to sit at a computer executing led . toggle () until the end of days. The benefits of using MicroPython start to become apparent when we integrate standard Python modules such as the time module. Semantically, we want to import the time module, and then use it make a delay for turning the LED on and off. We will also now shift to executing an entire program rather than just individual lines of code. Rather than exectuing the code in the Shell window, write the entire program in the main window and then save the file. When prompted as the where to save the file, select Raspberry Pi Pico so the code is save on the Pico itself. Hello, World! from machine import Pin led = Pin ( 25 , Pin . OUT ) led . toggle () With nothing other than the code above, try to import the time module, and use it to switch the LED on and off every second. The function time . sleep () may be of some use Python (and by extension, MicroPython ) are somewhat intuitive languages, so in order to accomplish the given task, we could try something along the lines of from machine import Pin import time led = Pin ( 25 , Pin . OUT ) led . toggle () time . sleep ( 1 ) led . toggle () where the highlighted lines are the only lines added to our previous program. To make this a truely labour-saving device, we could use a while loop: BlinkyBill.py from machine import Pin import time led = Pin ( 25 , Pin . OUT ) while True : led . toggle () time . sleep ( 1 ) Exerscise 4 What do you think will happen if you execute the above Program? Do it, and find out. LED lighthouse \u00b6 Look at us! Blinking an LED , what next!? Well, perhaps you find the transition from the LED flipping between on and off a bit harsh? Or maybe you want to emulate the romantic glow of a distant lighthouse flashing? In either case, this is something we can look into. But first, we need to discuss the what the Pico actually does when we tell it to output. The Pico has many Input (I) and Output (O) pins, with the full collection shown below: The pinout diagram for the Raspberry Pi Pico The pins that are of most interest to us are the GPIO pins, which as the name suggests are general purpose and can be assigned to perform a range of tasks (for example, illuminating an LED ). Importantly, any output from the Pico is a digital output, which is either on or off , 1 or 0 , which in reality correspond to the voltages 3.3\\mathrm{V} and 0\\mathrm{V} respectively. Contrast this to an analogue output would do: the voltage would be whatever I set it to be, whereas the digital output is comparitively a blunt instrument. So given it can only be either off or on , how are we going to dim our LED ? Exerscise 5 What is PWM ? What is duty cycle? Explain how PWM can be used to dim an LED . Smooth operator Here we are going to work through how one might build code from the \"ground up\". As stated previously, this typically involves looking at documentation and example code, altering it, breaking it, fixing it, and then hopefully achieving that which you set out do. In this case, we are going to use PWM to dim our LED . 1. Copy our code from above which blinks the LED on and off 2.

It is at this point that one could run pwm . duty_u16 ( duty ) where duty is any number between 0 and 65,025, yielding a duty cycle between 0% and 100% respectively. You may ask: How on Earth would I know to do that!? and the answer is you wouldn't: it comes from reading the docs . Learning to do this stuff requires much searching and reading, so don't worry if you don't immediately take it all in. The best part of it is that you can simply try to execute the code and see what happens, and make any changes as required.

We include a small sleep time just to make things smoother, as doing things too quickly can result in a flicker. Once we have increased through all possible values of the duty cycle, we can then turn around and descend through all values duty cycle, and then continue this forever by placing everything inside a while True loop. Digital analogue \u00b6 Playing with the onboard LED is great fun, but the purpose of these experiments is to build capacity for using a microcontroller in physics experiments, so we are going to branch out, and interact with componenets which are not directly attached to the Pico, and explicitly, our goal is to create a physical LED dimmer. Before we get to building a dimmer, we need to connect up our Pico to other components, and for this we are going to use a breadboard. Unfamiliar with electronics breadboards? Solderless breadboards , or simply breadboards , are a fantastic tool for prototyping electronics: they allow for a \"plug and play\" approach to building circuits, requiring few leads for connections and fi tting almost all standard components. Essentially, breadboards are an array or wire strips, connected in rows but not in columns. This means that to connect up two (or more) components, one must simply plug them into the same row. The image below shows the breadboard and the internal connections are annotated. The Pico has soldered headers which make it ideal to straddle the centre of the beadboard (i.e. columns C and H ) so we can easily connect jumper cables to any pin we desire. Our goal here is to replicate our LED adventure thus far but on an isolated LED rather than the on-board LED , but first, a quick note on LEDs. An LED is a semiconductor component that emits light when current flows through it. Importantly, in addition to emitting light, LEDs - and diodes more generally - only conduct current in one direction: ideally it has zero resistance for current flowing in the forward direction and infi nite resistance for current flowing in the reverse direction. It is therefore very important to pay attention to the polarity of an LED : in the wrong orientation, it will not allow current to flow nor will it produce any light. The positive side (anode) of the LED can be readily identi ed as it has a longer leg. Given that diodes have varying resistance dependent on the direction of current, they clearly do not obey Ohm's law. Rather, diodes require a certain voltage in order to \"turn on\", that is, to allow current to flow, but beyond this the current and voltage are mostly independent. The voltage required for operation is known as the foward voltage ( V_f ) and is typically in the range 0.3 - 2 \\mathrm{V} depending on the diode material. Even though LEDs are non-Ohmic devices, they emit light with a brightness proportional to the current passing through the diode, just light a globe. And much like a globe, if too much current is passed though the diode, it will be destroyed. Therefore a resistor must always be placed in series with the diode to limit the current a prevent damage to the LED . A circuit to safely power an LED Exerscise 6 Using the provided LED and 220~\\Omega resistor, construct the above circuit where the battery is replaced by an output of the Pico. This involves selecting a GPIO pin from the pinout and writing a program to turn that pin on . You should be able to manually switch the LED , or by altering previous pieces of code, either blink or pulse the LED . We are now going to use a potentiometer to control the brightness of our LED , but not by using the potentiometer to limit the current to the LED , but rather by using an analogue input of the Pico to sense the position of the potentiometer. A circuit control the LED brightness with a potentiometer The right-hand side of above circuit will sample that the potentiometer output, which is measured using an ADC, the details of which are provided elsewhere on this site , but the summary is that a signal continuous in both time and voltage is sampled which results in a signal discritised in both time and voltage. The accuracy of the voltage represenation will be determined by the resolution of the ADC, which is essentially determined by the maximum measurable voltage over the bit depth. For a Pico, the digitised signal will range in value from 0 - 65025 which represent signals of 0-3.3\\textrm{V} respectively. In order to programatically read the voltage, we simply need to import the ADC class and then tell the Pico which pin to read. Try running the below code, ensuring to verify the ADC pin on the Pico pinout : Potentiometer read from machine import ADC , Pin import time adc = ADC ( Pin ( 26 )) while True : print ( adc . read_u16 ()) time . sleep ( 1 ) Exerscise 7 By combining all our coding adventures, write a program which dims the brightness of an external (not on-board) LED based on the position of a potentiometer. Time to switch off (and on) \u00b6 Our final experiment is aims to externalise all that we have learnt. Specifically, there are many situations where we would like to control things that cannot be simply powered from our Pico. A real-world example might be the opening and closing of a garage door: the motors to drive the door require significant power, well beyond the capabilities of our Pi; however, if we were to simply control a switch in the motor circuit with our Pico, we could retain the programability of our Pico, with the functionality of the externally powered motor. The question is then, what is an electronically powered switch? It is at this point that we have come full circle, as the answer is a transitor .

It should then come as no surprise that the most basic building block of a digital system is a switch, which is either on or off . The magic starts to happen when we intoduce logic, namely devices which take input values and transform them to a single output value. A simple example of a logic gate is one constructed in a circuit as shown below: each of the two switches can either be open ( off ) or closed ( on ), but only when both switches are closed will the light be illuminated. An AND gate as depicted using switches in a circuit: only when both switches are closed will the light illuminate. To represent these structures mathematically, we can use truth tables, which adopt the convention of the off state being represented by 0 and the on state being depiced by 1 and display all states of the system.

The secret sauces which have let computation grow into the juggernaut that we know it to be are (information theory)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory] and transistors. The former we are not going to cover as it is a field onto itself, but the latter is much more unsterstanable: in short, transistors are effectively little switches, and our ability to make more transistors per unit area has drastically increased since we started making them 1 , so our ability to build systems capable of logical operations has also increased drastically. This is the story of computational power: better fabrication techquies for transistors means more powerful devices, simply as there are more little pieces of computation inside. A story which runs parallel to the development of computing hardware is software. At the end of the day, programming all of the logical operations required to complete a given task is tough work, and there is no way around having to do this: machine code is the only language that a computer speaks. However, as computaitonal power grows, the amount of power we are willing to dedicate to making our lives easier increases. A good example of this is an old operating system: if you look at early versions of windows, linux, or OS X, they typically look a little janky, laking polish. This isn't because it wasn't possible to do these things, it was because the amount of power required to do those things would mean performance for important tasks would be compromised; however, with a few years passing, one typically has much more computing power to play with, so for accomplishing the same important tasks, one can have a very shiny operating system. The same can be said for coding languages: we now commonly use \"shiny\" languages, which are not the most efficient languages, but are drastically easier to code. For example, python is the language of choice for most scientific applications, and whilst using a lower level language such as C would likely result in a faster computation, when both programs run faster than 100~\\textrm{ms} , the computation time often doesn't matter, and python has all the creature comforts of a high-level language. A microcontroller at home on a PCB We have discussed the construction of computational devices, and the development of cosy coding languages, and it the nexus of these that the user-friendly microcontroller was born. Microcontrollers are collections of logic gates which can be controlled to perform specific operations; however, programming them was not always easy. Moreover, When it came to deciding which microcontoller to use, there were many considerations (and hence a large number of microcontrollers in the wild). Delightfully, there has been somewhat of a revolution in the last decade with mass-produced, low-cost, and highly-accessible - easily coded - microcontollers being brought to market. It is here that we have our jumping off point: microcontollers (little computers) that we can easily control (using code) to control and measure all manner of things - which is a cornerstone of experimental physics.","title":"Microcontrollers"},{"location":"partII/digital/#apparatus","text":"The nature of this digital systems tutorial means that we will be performing a number of bite-sized experiments, and as such the apparatus will need to be reconfigured for each experiment; however, at the core of all experiments are two common elements.

Introduction \u00b6 Objectives \u00b6 To observe the wave-like properties of electrons interacting with an ordered atomic lattice.

Principal Data Taken \u00b6 Dimensions of the diffraction pattern produced by an electron beam projected onto a curved phosphor-coated screen as a function of accelerating voltage. Things to Watch Out For \u00b6 The high voltage power supply provides a small current (in the mA range) but a very high voltage. Ensure that all leads and connections are secure and protected before turning on either one of the power supplies. Observe all usual care and attention necessary when working with electricity. The bright spot in the centre of the phosphor screen has the potential to damage the screen if left on too long. Reduce the power supply voltages to zero once measurements have been made. Theoretical Background \u00b6 Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect showed that light, previously considered a wave phenomenon, also displays particle behaviour. In 1924 Louis de Broglie developed a generalised version of the equations relating the wavelength of light to the momentum of photons, and postulated in his doctoral thesis that particles might also display wave behaviour. de Broglie hypothesised that the inverse proportionality between wavelength and momentum should hold true for all particles; the electron was the lightest known particle at the time, so it was the easiest case for experimenters to test, which Davisson and Germer successfully did in 1928. Electrons accelerated by a high voltage have an associated kinetic energy, which means they have a corresponding linear momentum. Therefore according to de Broglie's formula we would expect those electrons to have an associated wavelength. Davisson and Germer tested this hypothesis by placing a suitable diffraction screen in the path of such an electron beam. Diffraction is an interference effect that is fundamental to the propagation of waves, and should be observable for electrons just as with any other wave. However, diffraction gratings developed for optical purposes are totally unsuitable for the demonstration of electron diffraction (briefly explain why in your report), so a quite different experimental set-up must be used. Consider a beam of electrons directed at a phosphorescent target. If the beam is not deflected then it will produce a single bright dot where electrons impact the screen. If a diffusing target is placed in the beamline, then individual electrons will scatter off of atoms in the target, creating a slightly blurred spot on the screen. The atoms in the target are fixed in position, with some regular or irregular spacing depending on the target material. If the electrons always behave as particles, then diffraction cannot occur and the pattern on the screen would resemble a Gaussian distribution. The pattern would change in intensity and width with increasing electron energy based on conservation of momentum applied to each electron-atom collision, but would always have a peak at the unscattered beam position and drop off smoothly with increasing scattering angle. On the other hand, if the electrons can behave as waves, then if the spacing between target atoms is comparable to the wavelength of the electron \"matter waves\", we would expect to see a diffraction pattern caused by interference between electrons scattered from atoms in different layers of the target. According to de Broglie's hypothesis, the electron wavelength is inversely proportional to their momentum, and so the minima and maxima of the diffraction pattern should change in a regular way with electron momentum (and therefore, electron energy, which is directly controlled by the experimenter). For this experiment, graphite has been deposited on a screen as a target. In this form, it is a poly-crystal with micro crystals oriented in many random directions, and we can therefore sample many angles of incidence without needing to vary the direction of the electron beam or the orientation of the target. If the wavelength of the incident light (or particle) is of the order of the separation between the atomic planes in the crystal, the planes will act as a three- dimensional grating. Discuss the following in your report The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is given by \\label{eqn:debroglie} \\lambda = h/p where h is Planck's constant, p is the particle momentum, and \\lambda is the wavelength. h takes the value 6.626 \\times 10 ^{-34} J \\cdot s = 4.136 \\times 10 ^{-15} eV \\cdot s. What is the predicted wavelength of an electron with kinetic energy K = 3 keV? If a ray of light had this wavelength, in what part of the electromagnetic spectrum would it be? Make an estimate of the spacing between atoms in a piece of graphite. Start by recalling that 12 grams of carbon-12 contain 6.022 \\times 10 ^{23} atoms, and the density of graphite is measured to be \\rho = 2.2 g \\cdot cm ^{-3} . This is only a rough estimate because the packing of individual layers of graphite into a solid varies greatly from sample to sample. State any assumptions you must make to derive your result. Assuming you have found that the spacing between graphite atoms is of the correct order of magnitude to demonstrate diffraction of an \\approx 3 keV electron beam, we can try to predict where we will see intensity maxima in the diffraction pattern, as a function of deflection angle and electron energy. Shown below is a simplified version of diffraction from a crystal lattice. The basic equations for scattering in a crystal were derived by Bragg to describe the interaction of high-energy radiation with matter, and Bragg's Law gives us the means to test de Broglie's hypothesis. Diffraction from so-called Bragg planes in a crystalline medium. The heavy solid line in the lower part of the beam path represents the additional path length $\\Delta$s travelled by the electrons in that part of the beam For constructive interference to occur, the path-length difference \\Delta s travelled by the electrons in one part of the beam relative to the electrons in another part of the beam must be equal to an integer number of de Broglie wavelengths, i.e. \\Delta s = n \\lambda . The graphite layers can be treated as a set of discrete layers as in the image above, which shows that the \\Delta s is related to the spacing of atoms in the crystal lattice, d , and the angle of incidence of the electron beam with respect to the surface of the target, \\theta . This geometry yields Bragg's Law: \\begin{equation} \\label{eqn:bragg} 2d\\sin\\theta = n\\lambda \\end{equation} \\theta may not be easy to measure (in this case, because the target is held at/near the centre of a sealed, evacuated chamber, but for planar geometry it is simply related to the deflection angle \\alpha between the undeviated beam path and the scattered electron path: \\begin{equation} \\theta = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}. \\end{equation} \\alpha can be determined by measuring the linear diameter of a the diffraction ring projected onto a screen combined with knowledge of the dimensions of the TEL-555 diffraction tube apparatus (see Procedure, below). Thus a measure of the diffraction ring diameter is tantamount to a measure of the electron wavelength. For your lab report Relate the electron wavelength to the accelerating voltage in the device by rewriting the de Broglie relation as a function of the charge q and mass m of the electron and the accelerating voltage V. Use the relativistic momentum formula p = \\gamma mv where \\gamma is the Lorentz factor from special relativity. Confirm that the electrons in a 5 keV beam are non-relativisitic (i.e., \\gamma \\approx 1). From this calculation you should make a prediction for how the diffraction angle \\alpha depends on accelerating voltage V. Procedure \u00b6 Make sure everything is turned off before you start, and that the EHT is set to zero using the slide control. Check all the connections and leads for safety and then turn on the EHT (switch is at the back). The EHT supply needs to warm up for about a minute before applying any voltage to the tube. Check that the heater is working by observing the glow at the rear of the tube. Slowly increase the voltage on the EHT until you start to see the rings on the phosphor screen. The minimum voltage is likely to be \\approx 2.5 kV. The rings will appear similar to those shown here (the image is a negative of the rings as observed on the phosphor screen). It is easier to see the rings if the room is dark. Starting at \\approx 2.5~kV as the lowest voltage, use callipers to measure the diameter of the two rings and record the voltage in about 5--10~steps up to the maximum of \\approx 4 kV. Make sure you include an estimate of your uncertainties in your tabulated data. As the voltage increases, the rings will get brighter and change in diameter. Higher voltages require a current that has the potential to damage the graphite target -- at all times keep an eye on the graphite target, and if it starts to glow turn off the apparatus for 10 minutes to let it cool. At the end of the data-taking phase, you should have enough data points to graph the trend of ring diameters versus voltage, with realistic errorbars in both dimensions. Both the absolute value of the diameters and the ratio of the diameters of ring 2 to ring 1 will be useful in your analysis. Calculations \u00b6 Some further work is required to accurately link your measurements of the ring diameters D _1 and D _2 to the diffraction angle \\alpha . This arises because the centre of curvature of the electron tube is significantly offset from the position of the graphite target (see the figure below). The distance between the graphite target and the screen is L , but the radius of curvature of the screen is R . Geometry of the electron tube and graphite target The numerical values of the relevant parameters are given in the table below: Parameter Symbol Value [mm] Target-phosphor distance L 125 \\pm 2 Screen radius R 65.0 \\pm 0.5 Glass tube thickness t 1.50 \\pm 0.05 If the target were located at the centre of curvature of the screen, the diffracted beam would travel a distance R, and the diffraction angle \\alpha would be easily related to the measured diameter of the ring. Instead, we need to relate it to the central angle \\phi ( R\\sin{\\phi} = D /2). Using the geometry as illustrated above, show that the angle \\alpha is given by: \\label{eqn:alpha} \\alpha = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{D/2}{(L-R)+\\sqrt{R^2-(D/2)^2}}\\right) Because you have directly measured D, the values in table above can be used to calculate \\alpha . We can now evaluate de Broglie's hypothesis on the wave nature of electrons by comparing the derived values of \\alpha to the predictions from the de Broglie relation and the Bragg condition. What relationship between \\alpha and voltage is expected based on your theoretical calculations? What do you need to plot on the {\\it x} and {\\it y} axes in order to produce a linear graph? Plot the appropriate graph for both the inner and outer rings (this can be done on the same graph). What can you say about the wave nature of electrons based on your results? The simple crystal plane schematic shown earlier dramatically simplifies the situation in a real crystal target. In particular, there is only one value of d given, which could therefore result in only one bright ring for each value of n. The fact that 2 rings are seen means that there are multiple spacings possible in the structure of the target material. Use your graph to determine the average atomic spacings in the target. Compare your results with the dimensions you found in the theoretical background section. Comment on the accuracy of your results and your errors. Use the ratio of D _2 to D _1 to learn the arrangement of the atoms in the crystal. For example, if the crystal is cubic, with adjacent atoms separated by distance a_0 (see below left), then there is a characteristic distance d _1 between atoms, and a second characteristic distance between atoms diagonally across from each other in the crystal lattice. This right-hand panel of the image below shows the face-on projection of a hexagonal crystal. Each pair of atoms constitutes an aperture that can produce diffraction. Left: Face-on view of a single cell of a cubic crystal structure showing the possible spacings between atoms Right: face-on view of a single cell of a hexagonal crystal structure showing the possible spacings Both cases produce two distinct diffraction rings, but with differing ratios D _2 :D _1 Show that for a cubic crystal the ratio D _2 :D _1 should be \\sqrt{2} :1. Show that a hexagonal crystal also creates effectively two relevant spacings, and that they are in the ratio of \\sqrt{3} :1.

In 1924 Louis de Broglie developed a generalised version of the equations relating the wavelength of light to the momentum of photons, and postulated in his doctoral thesis that particles might also display wave behaviour. de Broglie hypothesised that the inverse proportionality between wavelength and momentum should hold true for all particles; the electron was the lightest known particle at the time, so it was the easiest case for experimenters to test, which Davisson and Germer successfully did in 1928. Electrons accelerated by a high voltage have an associated kinetic energy, which means they have a corresponding linear momentum. Therefore according to de Broglie's formula we would expect those electrons to have an associated wavelength. Davisson and Germer tested this hypothesis by placing a suitable diffraction screen in the path of such an electron beam. Diffraction is an interference effect that is fundamental to the propagation of waves, and should be observable for electrons just as with any other wave. However, diffraction gratings developed for optical purposes are totally unsuitable for the demonstration of electron diffraction (briefly explain why in your report), so a quite different experimental set-up must be used. Consider a beam of electrons directed at a phosphorescent target. If the beam is not deflected then it will produce a single bright dot where electrons impact the screen. If a diffusing target is placed in the beamline, then individual electrons will scatter off of atoms in the target, creating a slightly blurred spot on the screen. The atoms in the target are fixed in position, with some regular or irregular spacing depending on the target material. If the electrons always behave as particles, then diffraction cannot occur and the pattern on the screen would resemble a Gaussian distribution. The pattern would change in intensity and width with increasing electron energy based on conservation of momentum applied to each electron-atom collision, but would always have a peak at the unscattered beam position and drop off smoothly with increasing scattering angle.

Introduction \u00b6 Objectives \u00b6 To observe and record time lap between signal transmitted and signal received. To measure speed of sound in air at two different temperatures. To estimate effects of temperature and humidity on speed of sound in air. Equipment \u00b6 The basic equipment is simple, consisting of an ultrasonic transmitter and a receiver, an Arduino Uno board to drive the transmitter, an amplifier attached to the receiver, and an oscilloscope for measuring the travel time of a burst of ultrasonic waves. You will control the transmitted signal from the Arduino using very simple code which is based on the C/C++ language. Some technical information on the ultrasonic transducers (probably more than you want to know!) is in an information folder on the equipment trolley. There are myriad Arduino resources online. Both transmitter and receiver have been mounted inside plastic tubes. Since you will want to know the exact positions of the transmitting and receiving surfaces inside the tubes, we have engraved grooves on the outside of the tubes, in the correct positions. Please do not poke anything down either tube. Principal Data Taken \u00b6 Time delay between sending and receiving a signal versus the distance travelled. Temperature and humidity of the ambient air. Things to Watch Out For \u00b6 The bench set up for this experiment is mobile, as you will need to vary the distance between sender and receiver. However, you will need to have power, so beware of cables on the floor and other students in the laboratory. Transducers, Arduino board, oscilloscope and computer are all already wired up. There is no need for you to connect or disconnect anything. Setting Up the Transducers \u00b6 The transducers are designed to operate at about 40 kHz. It is advantageous, however, to \"fine tune\" your pair so that they are operating at peak efficiency. Switch on the signal generator, and place transmitter and receiver facing each other less than a metre apart. Make sure that the transmitter is connected to the signal generator and that the receiver is connected to its amplifier (small metal box), which must be powered up. Use the C.R.O. to observe the amplifier output. Boot up the computer, and start the Arduino IDE . Load the file called tone_pin8.ino. The file should be located at C:\\\\Users\\Public\\Public Documents\\Ultrasonic\\tone\\_pin8.ino . This file has comments next to the commands which should explain what each one does. In the preamble variables are defined: FREQ in Hertz, duty and period in microseconds. FREQ allows you to set the frequency of the ultrasound emitted. Edit the value to about 40 kHz. duty or duty cycle, sets how long each ultrasonic pulse lasts. period sets the time between the pulses. The \"setup\" section configures the hardware on the board, the \"loop\" section has commands which are repeated endlessly. Save the file (shortcut; Ctrl + S ). The new parameters are loaded on the board by uploading the sketch file to the Arduino, (shortcut; Ctrl + U ). Experiment with values of {\\it duty} and {\\it period} to familiarise your self with what they represent. Now alter frequency until you find value which gives the maximum receiver output amplitude - and write it down in your lab notes! The transducers are now \"tuned\". Introductory Experiment \u00b6 Move the equipment trolley to a position about 1 metre from a smooth wall, or even better, a large pane of glass. Arrange the transmitter and receiver to be equidistant from the wall, one on either side of the sound absorbing screen. Use whatever simple tests you can devise to satisfy yourself that the receiver is indeed detecting a signal reflected off the wall. Just observing the reflected signal tells you nothing about the travel time of a particular wavefront from transmitter to wall and back, because all wavefronts are identical. Devise a means of measuring the travel time of the leading wave front of a particular burst of ultrasound. You will need to think carefully about what the trigger controls on the C.R.O. do, and about the significance of the various modes of trigger operation. It may also help to consider the following questions : Roughly how long, in milliseconds, will it take the first wave front of a burst to travel to the wall and back? During this time, what will the output of the receiver be? How can you trigger a sweep of the C.R.O. at the instant that you start a burst of ultrasound? You will also need to consider the period of the ultrasound bursts. Does your next burst from the transmitter occur before the reflection arrives at the receiver, confusing the temporal association of the transmitted with the reflected burst? Observe the time between your burst of ultrasound and the reflection. Is your prediction of travel time confirmed? You should discuss in your report how you confirmed that the time measurement taken was indeed for the same burst. The transmitter doesn't perform optimally when it is fed with a chopped sine wave and the amplitude of the sine wave is rather large at around 5V. Zoom in on the oscilloscope and look at the ~40 kHz waveform from the Arduino. The reflected signal isn't an exact copy, something akin to ringing is occurring in the transmitter, in addition to dispersion in the air and by the reflecting surface. Note that a certain amount of ultrasound penetrates through and diffracts around the sound-proof screen, so that the received signal is not zero during the \"off\" periods. By moving the transmitter and receiver about you should be able to minimise this unwanted signal. Procedure \u00b6 Using your setup, which should now be optimally tuned, you will measure the velocity of sound in the air and investigate its dependence on the temperature and humidity of the air in which it propagates. You now have a sort of sonar apparatus. Set it up so that the sound emitted reflects directly back to the receiver. Measure the transit distance using the measuring tape provided. Note that the groove on the transducer tube can be used to ascertain the position of the transducer in the tube. Do not stick measuring tape inside the tube. Measure transit time from the oscilloscope. Repeat the measurements over as wide a range of transmitter-to-wall distances as possible. You will plot a graph from this data and fit a linear function to it. You should be able to measure out to about 4-5 metres from the reflecting surface. Before and after your observations you should make some meteorological observations. On the trolley you should find a digital thermometer and humidity instrument, so keep a record of these values (it can be programmed to sample and record these values, it has a USB interface for communication) . One meteorological observation we are not asking you to make is a measurement of the barometric pressure. Why not? You should take a set of readings in a cold dark room for example, and another set in a warm environment, where the ambient temperatures differ as much as possible. A set of readings on a different day with different humidity would also be instructive. Calculations \u00b6 Having done all the above, you can now consider analysing your transit time measurements. First consider the following possible source of error. The oscilloscope time-base may be inaccurate. The calibration of time-base speeds around 1 ms. per cm. can be checked by feeding the C.R.O. with a wave of accurately known frequency and comparing its period with the period indicated on the C.R.O. screen. The Rhodes and Schwarz SMX signal generator in Lab 2 is a quality reference instrument. (This error applies more to the old analogue oscilloscopes, rather than the digital models, but worth checking). If a correction is necessary make sure that you get it the right way round; it is easy to make a mistake. Plot transit time versus distance. (The free R statistical software, or perhaps Python, are to be preferred over Excel, if you wish to become familiar with scientific grade tools) Use your graph or software to calculate the speed of sound. (This is rather a back to front approach for a ranging experiment. In practice one would measure the transit time and calculate the distance using an assumed speed of sound, but we are concerned with variations in the speed.) Remember to note estimates of distance and time measurement errors, as well as temperature and humidity error. These will contribute to an error in velocity. (Once again R has excellent tools for these kinds of calculations.) Carefully read the section in Kaye and Laby 1 on the speed of sound in air. A diagram from a paper by Harris 2 is included with these notes. (A copy of the complete paper is in the information folder.) The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 3 contains some useful tables too. What meteorological parameters particularly affect the speed of sound in air? Use your meteorological observations and the information in Kaye and Laby or elsewhere to estimate the speed of sound in your work area during your experiment. How does it compare with the value you obtain? Alternatively, start with your value of velocity and correct it to 0 ^{\\circ} C and zero humidity. How does this compare with the book value? How many standard deviations (from your error estimate) is your value from the theoretical? Discuss the following in your report With reference to the expression for speed of sound in any gas, show why pressure is not important in determining the speed of sound; by using the value for the gas constant R and the molecular mass of dry air, derive an expression for the speed that only depends on temperature. Especially concerning humidity , you could discuss the composition of air in terms of monatomic, diatomic and triatomic molecules, and how this affects the gamma value; the ratio of the specific heat of gas at constant pressure, to that at constant volume. How does the percentage of water molecules in the air affect the molecular mass? What is the effect of audio frequency on the speed of sound? What are the relative magnitudes of the effects of temperature and humidity? G. W. C. Kaye and T. H.

Emphasis is placed on self-directed learning and solving problems in the context of an extended investigation. Topics of investigation include atomic physics, nuclear & particle physics, electromagnetism, and optics. Structure \u00b6 Lab work is undertaken as part of the core third-year physics subjects KYA321 wave mechanics and quantum mechanics and KYA320 advanced electromagnetism which run in semesters one and two respectively. In both cases, lab work accounts for 25% of the subject mark and 36 hours of laboratory time is allocated for the semester. In actuality, experiments are conducted over a three-week period, with each experiment accounting for 16 contact hours. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants. Experiments are undertaken according to a flexible schedule, with access organised on an ad-hoc basis, with the exception being a weekly mandatory discussion session, which will be used to plan and discuss experiments, technical aspects of experimental science, and give \"whiteboard\" presentations. Current implementation \u00b6 The text below is taken from the MyLO pages for KYA320/KYA321, but, for the sanity of all involved, it is best to think of the lab program as a separate lab subject that operates in the background of the physics subjects that are currently being run. In short: as part of a physics major, you must complete 3 experiments and complete all assessments . Semester two, 2023 Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your third-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at complex phenomenon and build your ability to employ the scientific method. Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook, with a hurdle requirement being that you provide a brief presentation for each experiment. All information for the lab program is hosted on the lab website , including the available experiments (and associated documentation), reference material for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more. Labs are co-ordinated by Andy McCulloch, and all enquiries should be directed to the physics lab mailbox . Summary \u00b6 You must complete two experiments for the semester. Each experiment involves the production of a logbook and has a hurdle requirement of an informal presentation. Additionally, you must produce a formal lab report based on an experiment of your choice from any time in the year; this task includes a round of assessed peer assessment and a presentation. Schedule \u00b6 Labs will run in three blocks of labs, each lasting for three weeks. The dates for semester two, 2022 are as follows: Experiment block one: weeks 3, 4, and 5 (July 24th - August 13th), with logbooks to be submitted to the block one dropbox by the end of Sunday, August 13th Experiment block two: weeks 6, 7, and 8 (August 14th - September 10th), with logbooks to be submitted to the block two dropbox by the end of Sunday, September 10th During each block, whiteboard presentations are to be undertaken during the common lab session (Monday, 1400 - 1700 in the part III lab) in second week of the block, or explicitly: Experiment block one: Monday July 31st Experiment block two: Monday August 21sh A final block is to be dedicated to scientific communication: Week 10: report preparation. Submission for peer assessment to the relevant dropbox by the end of Friday, September 22nd Week 11: Peer assessment and editing. Peer assessment feedback due for submission to the appropriate dropbox by the end of Tuesday, September 26th, and final report to be submitted to the dropbox by the end of Sunday, October 1st Week 12: Lab report presentations.

The weighting of assessments for this semester is as follows: Experiment one (30%) Experiment two (30%) Scientific communication: report (20%), presentation (10%), and peer assessment (10%) Experiments \u00b6 Over the course of the two subjects, it is expected that you will complete five experiments. It is suggested that you pick experiments which interest you, but also across of range of subjects to ensure exposure to diverse content. Current experiments Experiments under development Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy Nuclear physics This experiment explores \\gamma radiation, investigating the interaction between \\gamma rays and matter, and applying this understanding to the identification of unknown materials. The lifetime of the muon Particle physics Muons are naturally occurring subatomic particles that originate from the interaction between cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei. In this experiment muons are captured into an absorber, and then the rate of muon radioactive decay is measured using a scintillation detector. From the rate of decays, the half-life of the muon can be determined. Microwave waveguides Electromagnetism The aim of this experiment is to measure the characteristics of a section of waveguide and subsequently examine the reflection, transmission and adsorption due to an obstacle placed in the guide. Nuclear magnetic resonance Atomic physics, quantum mechanics Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool in modern healthcare. This experiment examines the underlying physics, allowing students to investigate the magnetic field characteristics required, and measure the spin relaxation times of a sample (mineral oil). The production and characterisation of X-rays Atomic physics Atoms bombarded by electrons with energies on the order of 10-100 keV are observed to produce X-rays by the Bremsstrahlung mechanism, and also through ionization from inner shell energy levels. In this experiment a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube is used to detect the characteristic X-rays produced by a copper sample. Scattering these X-rays through a lithium fluoride crystal allows the student to measure the energy dispersion of these X-rays. Scattering of \\alpha radiation Nuclear physics Students test the angular dependence of scattering for gold, silver and aluminium foil. They may also measure the energy distribution of pulses from the silicon semiconductor detector in order to investigate the source spectrum and energy resolution of the detector. The experiment provides an introduction to the techniques of energy measurement for fast charged particles, the use of pulse height analysis and vacuum systems. It also increases awareness of statistical problems associated with nuclear measurements. Solar spectroscopy Astrophysics, optics Students obtain digital Solar spectra through the whole visual region and use these to identify all strong lines and their species, together with undertaking a particular study of the violet resonance lines of ionized calcium to estimate the calcium abundance in the Sun. The Zeeman effect in Mercury Atomic physics, optics, quantum mechanics The anomalous Zeeman splitting of the green line of mercury is observed using a Fabry-Perot Interferometer. The value of the Bohr magneton is obtained and the polarization of the line is studied. The experiment complements the lectures on the Zeeman effect and gives experience in the measurement of magnetic fields and in high-resolution spectroscopy. Experiment Branch(es) of physics Summary Atomic force microscopy Quantum mechanics, Optics Optical tweezers Optics, statistical mechanics Experiment selection \u00b6 The selection process is a combination of research, that is, having a look through the experiments as they are listed above (especially at the flavour profiles as listed on the experiment pages) and also attending the first common lab session, during which time we will discuss practicalities of the lab program, but you will also be able to have a look at the experiments and informally discuss with the academics responsible for the labs over energy dense foods. Details will be circulated about the event near the commencement of labs. Once you have decided on your preference for experiments, get in contact with the coordinating academic (listed on individual experiment webpages) and they will coordinate things from there, providing you with information about the running of the experiment and conducting an individual experiment induction. Before you undertake your experiment, ensure that you have completed the induction checklist Assessment \u00b6 As part of each experiment, you will be expected to maintain an experimental logbook upon which you will be assessed. There is also a hurdle requirement that for each experiment you will give a short \"whiteboard\" presentation to your peers about your experiment to your peers. Additionally, once per semester you are required to prepare a formal report on one experiment, which will include a peer assessment process.

Whiteboard presentations \u00b6 The cohort of people undertaking the third-year lab program is small, and is ripe for collaboration and discussion. Moreover, succinctly communicating complex ideas is a critically important part of the scientific endeavour. It is for these reasons an informal presentation, which is not assessed but is a hurdle requirement for the completion of each lab, will be given by each lab group to the rest of the lab cohort during the common session. It is expected that you will provide an overview of the experiment: what is the relevant physics, what are you going to measure and how are you going to measure it, and how will your analysis take place. This is not meant to be an imposition, but rather a process to reflect, solidify understanding and communicate openly with a group of interested people. Popular-science pitch \u00b6 Information on how to prepare, and what is expected for a Popular-science pitch can be found in the reference section of POLUS . Lab reports \u00b6 Information on how to prepare, and what is expected for a lab report can be found in the reference section of POLUS . Presentations \u00b6 Information on how to prepare, and what is expected a presentation can be found in the reference section of POLUS . Practicalities \u00b6 Prior to performing any experiments, it is a requirement that you have completed the lab induction . Labs take place in one of the part III labs (rooms 140, 231, 233) in the mathematics and physics building located on the Sandy Bay campus. Common sessions will be held in the part II/III lab (233), which you are welcome to attend (and encouraged to attend) at your leisure.","title":"Home"},{"location":"partIII/#home","text":"The part III labs are associated with 300-level subjects.

In actuality, experiments are conducted over a three-week period, with each experiment accounting for 16 contact hours. Experiments are conducted in collaboration with another student, but the program is designed to foster collaboration and to cultivate a collegiate environment amongst all participants.

In short: as part of a physics major, you must complete 3 experiments and complete all assessments . Semester two, 2023 Experiments are a cornerstone of science, and during your third-year studies, you will undertake a series of experiments which allow one to probe at complex phenomenon and build your ability to employ the scientific method. Labs are conducted in pairs, and the primary mode of assessment will be your experimental logbook, with a hurdle requirement being that you provide a brief presentation for each experiment. All information for the lab program is hosted on the lab website , including the available experiments (and associated documentation), reference material for to aid in the execution of experiments and the preparation of materials to be assessed, along with general content such as FAQs and guides for usage of hardware, software, common coding tasks, and more.

This may be a simple arithmetic algorithm or something vastly more exotic, but in all cases, computations form the basis for predictions in science, and the best tools we have for performing computations are (the aptly named) computers. Here one will find information on the computational tools that one will encounter in the physics program here at UTAS . Introduction \u00b6 Traditionally when studying physics, one will study electromagnetism and as part of this, one covers the important application of electrical circuits. The extension of analogue components to digital systems is often discussed in passing, and in an advanced physics study, the underlying quantum mechanics of discrete components is discussed (for example, how does a MOSFET function). Whilst this knowledge is useful, it is not necessary to operate a computer, and increasingly, it is critically important that one be aware of the power the can be accessed by computers for all manner of tasks, but also be fluent in computational techniques. It is not the role of physics to teach computer science, but it is the role of physics to teach the usage of computer usage and computation in a scientific context. Computation in the curriculum \u00b6 As part of the physics major, explicit blocks of computational content will be covered. As part of KYA211: Waves and Kinetic Theory , a four-week course on data handling is run to build proficiency in the collection, analysis, and presentation of experimental data. In KYA321: Wave Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics , computational physics laboratories are undertaken for six weeks with the aim of establishing competency in computational methods as applied to scientific problems. Beyond this, computational content may be baked into various courses, and experimental labs will make use of the computational literacy that has been developed in both the data handling and computation physics components of the degree. Tools of the trade \u00b6 If you pose the question which is best? to someone that is enthusiastic about computation, computers, or technology about any given aspect of their interest, you will likely be treated to a \"detailed\" response. This is because in most circumstances, there is no correct response, rather there are pros and cons, and one must make choices depending on the context. A pertinent example in the context of computational techniques in science is the choice of programming language: certain languages are blisteringly fast, but often come with significant overheads to achieve these speeds (notably knowledge and coding prowess), whereas other languages emphasise readability and accessibility, which comes at the cost of execution time or perhaps a fee. In science, common computational tools (languages or packages) one might encounter are: Programming languages Python R C C# Fortan Packages Mathematica Matlab LabVIEW Each language has its time and place, and with proper training, moving between languages and packages isn't much of a burden: the underlying principles of scientific computation do not change, rather just the means for implementing the computation. Consequently, the choice of language is somewhat arbitrary; however, there are some considerations which elevate some languages above others for general situations: Open source Human readable Well documented and supported Broadly compatible Broad applicability and extensive libraries The language that best ticks these boxes is (arguably) python , and as such it is common to see it as the go-to language, and indeed, it is the language of choice here at UTAS . This doesn't mean that you cannot use other tools or languages, but the only supported language is python . Using python \u00b6 Using python is simple enough, although it is a little more involved then an ordinary application. This is because unlike an ordinary application, as you write programs, you are often going to require the addition of new libraries or packages to aid with performing specific tasks, and thus a framework exists for collecting, organising, and compartmentalising these libraries. If one plays fast and loose with the management of these packages, that is where things can go awry, so it is worthwhile to spend a little time in the beginning to save yourself much more time down the road. UTAS also provides a platform for a streamlined python experience, which whilst less configurable, for the overwhelming majority of tasks it will be perfectly suited. The specifics of learning to write and execute python code is something to be found elsewhere, but in many circumstances the use of Jupyter , a web-based interactive development environment , is a great place to start 1 . Detailed below are different ways of accessing Jupyter for python use. Local usage \u00b6 Local usage of python as the name suggests means that an instance of python will run on the machine that you are using. This machine might be a university machine, for example a lab machine, or it might be your personal computer. University machines \u00b6 University machines (as configured for the physics labs) have python installed in the form of the Anaconda distribution . Anaconda is a popular flavour of python in the science community as most of the libraries that you are want to use are included in the base distribution. To start Jupyter for use with python using the Anaconda distribution, one can start Anaconda Navigator for a GUI oriented experience, or one can use the Anaconda Prompt for a command line experience. If using the navigator, one can select either Notebook or JupyterLab to start the IDEs, and if using the command line, one can execute either jupyter notebook or jupyter lab to start the web interface. What is the difference between launching Jupyter notebook and Jupyter Lab ? A Jupyter notebook is where computations are conducted, whereas the hub is a more fleshed-out environment for executing Jupyter notebooks. So if you just want to quickly execute code, a notebook is probably what you want, whereas if you want to navigate directories and want the experience to be slightly more general than just running python commands, then lab is the better choice. A major limitation of using the university machines is that should you wish to use a package which is not included in the Anaconda distribution, it is difficult (if not impossible) to make that happen. Fortunately, the distribution is expansive and it is unlikely that you would require something outside of the goodies already packaged. Personal machines \u00b6 Using python on a personal machine can be identical to using python on a university machine , except the Anaconda distribution must first be installed. You may also choose to pursue another path for python installation, and the usage of a search engine can provide ample paths to follow; however it is recommended that you install Anaconda. It is worth noting that whilst the distribution contains many files, and consequently it may take quite some time to install, even incredibly modest machines (think low-power single-board computers) can execute python code quickly and without issue. For many applications, computational power is really not an issue, and any device will be capable of near-instantaneously calculating the quantities of interest. Cloud usage \u00b6 Local usage , especially on one's own machine, has a special kind of power in the form of limitless configurability; however, sometimes one wants something that is easily accessible and just works. In these circumstances, it might be best to remotely execute python code, or in the case, remotely execute a Jupyter notebook. To that end, you are able to access Jove 2 , a Jupyter notebook server, which allows you to use notebooks remotely. Like other cloud services, this means that you can access and execute your code from anywhere; there are limits to the computational resources that are allocated to each notebook instance and how much storage can be used by a given user, but for most tasks these limits are very generous and it is unlikely that they will prove restrictive. To access Jove , click the button below: Access the jupyter notebook server Jove In order to use the service, you are required to make an account, which can be done as shown in the animation below: The signup process for `Jove` From here, a notebook session should be spawned upon logging in. It is worth noting that if you are inactive for a period, the session will automatically close. It can immediately be reopened, but in order to ensure equitable distribution of computation resources, inactive sessions must be closed. Cloud computing = someone else's problem Cloud computing is a phrase that is bandied around with little care or thought, but it is not magic: if you are running code on \"the cloud\", the code is not being executed on your machine, but it is being executed on someone else's machine. In this case, it is a server allocated to physics from TPAC (for which were are appreciative) and is maintained by the facilities manager in physics . If you have used any other cloud instance of Jupyter , you will appreciate the experience offered by Jove , and if you haven't, well, take it on faith that using them isn't always a positive experience. With that in mind, please treat to resource with respect lest it need be canned. Markdown \u00b6 [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language which can be used to simply and beautifully format text^[3], with a major advantage being that even when it is not rendered, it is easily readable by humans, unlike say, HTML . Another advantage to many in the sciences is that when one is using [Jupyter](#using-python) notebooks to aim with programming in python , one can use markdown to embed formatted text in the notebook, making the code eminently readable. Indeed, it is for this reason that experimental logbooks are required to be prepared using markdown . Provided below are some tips and tricks for preparing markdown content, but there are countless excellent resources[^4] on the web for learning markdown, so you are encourage to look around.

Rather, a suite of support and reference materials for skills and techniques which are key to applying the scientific method in the physics context are provided. Uncertainties \u00b6 Any result or measurement which is presented numerically should always be accompanied by a numerical estimate of its accuracy or reliability. Values will normally be presented in the form b \\pm \\Delta b . The reader of the report will know that they can expect the true value of the quantity to be within \\Delta b of b with some high degree of probability. In physics it is common to refer to the uncertainties as the errors , and the value of \\Delta b as the errorbar (named for the way the quantity appears on a graph), but this does not imply that the experimenter made a blunder or mistake! Every experiment carries errors with it and no quantity can be measured perfectly. The goals of experimental physics are to minimise errors as much as possible, and to understand the circumstances that produce the remaining errors. By convention, the values of \\Delta b are referred to the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution because this allows them to be easily manipulated and combined according to the rules below. Under this convention, the uncertainty estimate \\Delta b is often referred to by the Greek letter \\sigma (sigma). Because of the shape of the normal distribution, the true value of b is only expected to fall within the range b \\pm \\sigma about 68\\% of the time. b will be found within 2 \\sigma of the true value about 95\\% of the time, and within 3 \\sigma over 99.7\\% of the time (keep in mind that real errors are rarely perfectly normally distributed, and real results seem to fall more than 3 \\sigma away from their expectation values with discouragingly high frequency). Standard rules exist for the estimation of \\Delta b . They vary according to the circumstances of the measurement, and are summarised below.

This will take account the method used and the difficulty encountered in the observation. For example, the width of the pointer on a dial meter, parallax between the pointed and the printed scale, imprecision in the markings on a ruler, or the manufacturer's claims about the accuracy of a voltmeter. This may also include a component to allow for the judgment (good, bad, or otherwise) of the observer. Note that there is a strong human tendency at the subconscious level to underestimate the uncertainties associated with any particular measurement. A derived quantity \u00b6 When a quantity is determined by combining measurements of a number of directly measured quantities, the techniques of propagation of error must be employed. Let the desired result X be some function of a set of measurements, a, b, c, ... , of different quantities. The errors in each measurement, \\Delta a , \\Delta b , ..., are assumed known. Then \\left( \\Delta X \\right) ^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial a} \\Delta a \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial b} \\Delta b \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial c} \\Delta c \\right) ^2 \\dots The symbol \\partial refers to a partial derivative; ask your demonstrator for assistance if you forget how these work. The general rule for propagation of error can be reduced to some simple arithmetic forms for a number of commonly encountered cases, for example: Error in a sum or difference \u00b6 X = a \\pm b \\Delta X = \\sqrt{\\left( \\Delta a \\right) ^2 + \\left( \\Delta b \\right) ^2} Note that the error \\Delta X is the same whether a and b are added or subtracted. However the {\\it fractional} error, \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} , will be very different. In particular, if a and b are nearly equal, the fractional error in their difference may be enormous. The relation for \\Delta X can obviously be extended to the sum or difference of any number of quantities. The key feature is that the uncertainty \\Delta X is never less than the largest uncertainty on any of the components of X . Error in a product or quotient \u00b6 X = a \\times b or X = a/b \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) ^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\Delta b}{b}\\right) ^2} Again this can be extended to the products and/or quotients of any number of quantities. This is very similar-looking to the relation for sums and differences, but in this case it is the {\\it fractional} errors that are added in quadrature to derive the final uncertainty. The key feature here is that the fractional uncertainty on \\Delta X is never less than the largest fractional uncertainty among the components of X . Errors in quantities raised to powers \u00b6 X = a^n \\frac{\\Delta X}{X} = n \\left( \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) This can be calculated from the basic rule using partial derivatives, but it is a particularly useful relation to have in mind when analysing your data. For example, if the fractional error on a measured velocity is 5\\%, then the fractional error on the associated kinetic energy ( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 ) is 10\\%, because the velocity is squared in the energy calculation. Errors in evaluations of functions \u00b6 If X = f(a) , then the basic rule for propagation of error from the sum of squares of the partial derivative of X with respect to a must be followed. Example: X = a \\sin(b) According to the partial derivative rule, \\left(\\Delta X\\right)^2 = \\left( \\Delta a \\sin b\\right)^2 + \\left( a\\Delta b \\cos b\\right)^2 . This can result in some apparently strange behaviour: in this example, \\Delta X is insensitive to errors in a when b \\approx 0 or \\approx \\pi , but will be insensitive to errors in b when b \\approx \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2} or a \\approx 0 . A quantity measured many times \u00b6 A reasonable way of improving the precision of a measurement is to make a number of independent estimates of the quantity if possible. The best estimate of the true value of the quantity is then the mean of the individual results ( \\bar{b} ), and we can try to disentangle two different contributions to the total uncertainty: a statistical component arising from random, uncorrelated measurement errors, and a systematic component that affects all of the measurements (for example, an incorrectly calibrated thermometer, or something that depends on a consistent delay in your reaction time). The random component can be reduced by repeat measurements, but the systematic component cannot-- so note that if the systematic component is large it is futile to attempt to reduce the total uncertainty by repeating the measurements multiple times. In order to find the random component of the uncertainty in a measurement, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the sample, s . The quantity s represents the degree of scatter in the data, and if the uncertainties are truly random then s should be normally distributed. The relationship between the error in a single measurement and the error in the mean of N independent measurements is simply given by \\Delta \\bar{b} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} . Note that in the ideal case, the uncertainty on each measurement \\Delta b is the same, and s = \\Delta b . Significance of the result \u00b6 The number of significant figures in the result should be consistent with the stated accuracy. For example, 3.9 \\pm 0.0798234 and 3.93765 \\pm0.08 are both incorrect, while 3.94 \\pm 0.08 would be acceptable. Since the standard error is only an estimate of where you believe the 68\\% probability limits lie, experimenters sometimes drop the last digit of precision if they feel the rounded off value more accurately represents the state of knowledge about the measured quantity. Always bear in mind that systematic errors often dominate the total uncertainty, and these may be both large and difficult to quantify. Least-squares fit to a straight line \u00b6 Given a set of points ( x_i , y_i ), we often need to find m , b such that the line y = mx + b gives the best straight line fit to the data in the \"least squares\" sense. That is, the required line is such that the sum of the squares of the discrepancies of each point from the closest point on the line is a minimum. This is best done by using a computer (or some graphics calculators). Statistics programs will estimate the most likely slope m and intercept b from the data supplied. They will also estimate the standard errors \\sigma_m and \\sigma_b of m and b respectively. With these four numbers, one can say that, if there really is a linear relation between x and y , then the slope of that relation has a 68\\% chance of lying within \\pm \\sigma_m of m and the intercept has a 68\\% chance of lying within \\pm \\sigma_b of b . The theory underlying the method, and the procedure for computing linear least-squares fits by hand is given in the texts referred to in the Introduction above, and many other places. Warnings \u00b6 Measuring a quantity many times and performing a least-squares fit will assist you in estimating the random uncertainty due to statistical effects, but will not help you in determining possible systematic errors. This will require some common sense, some physical reasoning, and some experience. You will have to judge the systematic errors as best you can, and then combine them appropriately with your statistical uncertainty estimates. Never apply linear regression calculations to a set of figures unless you have plotted a graph and confirmed that the results are consistent with a linear relation! A common occurrence is to have something go wrong in the experiment which transforms the points into a gentle curve. The experimenter may plug the data into a line-fitting routine, which always comes up with a result. If the curve is small, then the reported standard error in the slope will be small, and there may be no indication that the result is in fact meaningless. {\\it Always} plot a graph of your data. Then, if the results are consistent with a straight line, use a least-squares fitting routine. In some of the experiments in \\unitname , the results take the form of a power law, which can easily be transformed into a straight line suitable for fitting. Communication \u00b6 Logbooks \u00b6 It is likely that in any study that you have undertaken which involves project work that you have been encouraged in to keep a log book. In many instances, these can often appear as a collection of scribbles: a date, a few measurements, maybe a table of raw data, but rarely is there a formal structure or in reality, anything that will remain useful. This is unfortunate, as in practice, logbooks are a cornerstone of rigorous and efficient work. The realisation that this is the case typically comes after some extended period of working on a complex project, where it is simply too difficult to recall minor technical details or re-tread a train of thought, which leaves you wondering \"what on Earth was I thinking/doing?\". It is in this context the we seek to embed the practice of careful, reasoned, and useful log-book keeping. The general idea \u00b6 Rather than thinking of a log as a cache of details pertinent to a given project, one should try to think of an experimental log as capturing your background research, experimental plan(s), methods and techniques, experimental data, data analysis, presentation of results, and conclusions but in a less formal and highly-educative manner. As much as you are writing to convince someone reading the log, you can use it to reason with yourself, in a way which allows the document to act as a conduit to place you back into your state of mind at the time of writing. It can often be difficult to appreciate the need for such diligent record keeping in the abstract, but this will have to be a leap of faith. Think of it like brushing your teeth: something the you are essentially forced to do, and at a later stage you a thankful that you have a habit that really improves your life. The log mantra \u00b6 A log should not be constructed in a prescriptive way, although there will be many common elements incorporated in well-maintained logs. In the specific case of an experimental log for a single project, you will have some materials to point you in the direction of what you are to investigate. From here, you can write something along the lines of a background section. This would contain a broad summary what you expect that you are going to do. What might be the aim of the experiment, and what are the relevant phenomenon. It should be emphasised that we are trying to move away from right and wrong, and rather discuss things that might be important. For example, if one is going to be performing an experiment involving diffraction, it may be worthwhile to explain what underpins the phenomenon: what exactly is the origin of diffraction? What are the implications of diffraction occurring, and how might these manifest in the experiment. The scope and explicit content to cover will be dependent on the experiment, but you want to provide yourself and the reader a comprehensive discussion of the phenomenon under investigation. With the (back)ground work laid, one basically enters the real-time cycle of writing a scientific method stream of consciousness: What do I want to do? Why do I want to do it? How am I going to do it? Why am I going to do it that way? What did I see? Why did I see it? What are the implications of seeing it? Once again, the exact flavour of this will depend on the task at hand, but basically you want to be explaining what you are doing and critically, why you are doing it. The markers of a successful log often take the form: I want to do this, and this is what I would expect I see this thing completely at odds to that which I would expect. I wonder why that might be I just had an idea, I am going to test it by doing _____ Okay, the results from that make sense, I know what is going on (proceeds to explain what is going on and implications) You may remark that this is just like the process one would follow for problem solving or troubleshooting, and you would be correct! These processes are essentially identical, with the spice in the mix for scientific experiments, you might know what you are expecting to observe, so it can be tricky to determine if what you observe is that what you think to be \u2013 a void largely filled by theory and simulations but in all cases, careful experimentation trumps all! Hints \u00b6 At first, writing a log is not easy as it requires that one plan ahead, and then often demands that one slow down and parse what the world is offering up. But to be clear: with the exception of the background material, a log is to be written in real time, and consequently mistakes will be made. Mistakes are to be embraced: you can explain what was done wrong, or what was required to correct your understanding. To emphasise: to purpose of this document is to document both what you did, but also what you learned. The presentation of a log is not the most important thing, but it should not be overlooked. It should be well laid out, easy to read, and the thread of the experimental journey should be easily followed. It is simply not possible to construct on scientific report style log, as a formal report has clearly defined sections, whereas a log exists in the moment, but the log should contain essentially all of the information that would be present in a formal report. One of the purposes of a log is to provide a vehicle for the development of ideas, so if something strikes you, embrace it. Do you have an idea for something that could be done better? Write it down. Unsure of one particular aspect of a theory? Write it down. Can you think of a complementary way to measure the same or similar phenomenon? Write it down. Insightful comments and/or discussions which arise from a comprehensive understanding of a given topic and command over the relevant adjacent materials are the true currency of a log, and science more broadly. Logs are individual. Despite that physics rightly is undertaken in collaboration with others, each person should be maintaining an individual log. It is strongly recommended that logbooks be produced digitally, ideally prepared within a Jupyter notebook . For part III labs, this in mandatory, and in Part II labs it is encouraged, but not required. Model log book \u00b6 An example log book is provided below as a guide for the kind of logbook that might be produced. Hopefully the text above has convinced you that there is no single right way to create a log, so you should do what works for you, whilst building on the principles which undergird rigorous scientific investigation. An example logbook prepared as a jupyter notebook An executable version of the example notebook above. This is one of the major advantages of using jupyter notebooks! Additional resources to aid with the production of jupyter notebooks will be forthcoming, but in the meantime, please consult with your demonstrator should you have any questions or problems. Assessment \u00b6 Assessment of logs will be conducted in the same way as any other report you have done in the past, in that physical insight and good experimental technique will be rewarded. In addition, a mandatory \"reflections\" section provides a pathway to improving one's logs and log-keeping technique, with the comments from the previous experimental logs to be addressed, with marks being awarded for engagement with the \"reflection\" process Reports \u00b6 The purpose of a report is to concisely communicate your findings to an audience in a structured document; in science, reports are often flavoured as commissioned pieces of research (for example, a study of the feasibility of microgrids for remote communities ) or academic research (for example, journal articles). Preparing a report \u00b6 Reports must be set out in the nature of a scientific paper with sections outlining the theory, experimental procedure, results and analysis, and conclusions. Each of those sections should carry the appropriate heading. All reports must have a brief abstract at the beginning and a list of references at the end. The crucial questions to ask yourself on completing a first draft of your report are Could someone else read this, and duplicate the experiment to reproduce my results? If someone else had written this and given it to me to read, would I believe it? If unfamiliar with this structure, it is advisable to have a have a look at existing reports, for example, articles which appear in any of the Physical Review publications are likely to be worth emulating. Note that some of the more general-coverage publications such as New Scientist or Scientific American employ their own styles which are aimed at a general audience and should not be taken as examples of a research report (but may be emulated in the case of a popular-science pitch ). The exact layout of a report will depend on the nature of the experiment, but a typical paper would have the following sections: Abstract Introduction Theory Experimental procedure Results and analysis Conclusion References Abstract \u00b6 The purpose of the abstract is to summarise the subject and findings of your work in one short paragraph. Typically, scientists will want to check several journals in a few minutes to see if any contain reports of interest to them in their field. They will check the contents page and then read the abstracts of those reports that may be of interest. Increasingly, scientists subscribe to services that email a list of abstracts in their field, a dozen or more per day. The abstract is your only chance of catching the attention of the people you want to read your report. If your abstract is not concise and to the point, then no one will read the report. It should contain a few words (normally less than about 50) outlining what has been done, what is new or interesting about the method you have used, the results and conclusions. It should include numerical results obtained where this was an aim of the experiment, and their standard error. If the results are significantly different from accepted values, this should be commented on. You are strongly advised to look at some examples in journals in the library or online (often, these are best found on https://journals.aps.org/prl/ ), or flatter your demonstrator by asking to see one they\u2019ve written. Introduction \u00b6 If the abstract has caught the attention of a reader, their next step will be to read the introduction. The introduction should not just repeat the contents of the abstract, but should assume the abstract has been read, and expand on it. In particular, it should give the object of the experiment and a general outline of the theory and method. It will probably include an outline of previous related measurements and attempt to show how the experiment contributes to the store of information on the subject. Appropriate comparisons may be made here with alternative methods, and the historical significance of the experiment may be commented on if this is relevant. Theory \u00b6 The theory underlying the experiment should be given. Where the script for the experiment describes the mathematics in detail, there is a conflict between the requirements of a bona fide original research report in which relevant theory is often skimmed over and a result given with citation to the appropriate works in the literature, and the requirements of a marked report in which your marker is looking for evidence that you have worked through the maths yourself and understood what you were doing. From the marking point of view, there is no point in copying out a slab of theory verbatim from the experiment notes. In this case you should summarise the notes in your own words, in a manner that makes it clear that you understand the process. In any case, you should refer to this handbook, giving page numbers and equation numbers where relevant, and the major steps in the theory should be written up. Where the script asks students to prove certain statements or equations, this should be done and described in the report. If the theory is descriptive and short, it may be appropriate to include it in the introduction. Experimental procedure \u00b6 Describe the procedure and apparatus used, with diagrams, to the extent that they are relevant to your results. Do not include detailed descriptions of equipment which cannot reasonably have affected the outcome of the experiment. Discuss difficulties encountered and methods used to overcome them. Results and analysis \u00b6 Final results should either be tabulated or displayed as graphs, as appropriate. If you use graphs, then the numerical results should be included in an appendix for marking purposes, referred to in the text by table or figure number. Each table and graph or diagram should have a table or figure number and brief caption describing it. Methods of analysis should be given but detailed calculations and measurements leading up to these results are not normally included in a scientific paper. It should go without saying that graphs must be clearly labelled with a legend, with clear distinction between data points and any theoretical or numerical curves or fits, and clear axis labels. Any information necessary to interpret the graph should be included in a brief caption. Error limits should be given for all numerical results and for all intermediate quantities which make a significant contribution to the accuracy of the final result. This is especially important in the abstract and the final conclusions. The error should always be quoted to the same power of ten as the result itself, and to the same significant figure, e.g. 1.67 \\times 10^{-19} \\pm 2 \\times 10^{-21} and (1.67 \\pm 0.0234) \\times 10^{-19} should be replaced by (1.67 \\pm 0.02) \\times 10^{-19} . Error bars should be attached to data points on graphs unless they are too small, in which case a comment should be attached to that effect. The method of calculation of errors should be indicated in the text. You should also discuss possible systematic errors, and if you can, possible ways of increasing the precision of the measurements. The goal of an experiment is to answer a question (e.g., is this theory true or false?). Without a clear discussion of the experimental uncertainties associated with a given numerical value, it is impossible to safely assign any credence to the value, or use it to answer the question. There is often a conflict between the way a scientist would lay out his/her report in a genuine research situation, and the requirements of a marker reading a student report in order to decide whether the student has understood the work and used appropriate experimental techniques, in order to attach a mark. If the scientist is demonstrating a relation between two variables, the result will be expressed in graphical form, or as an equation if it is possible to fit a relation. The reader will not be interested in the fine details of the calculation, but will assume that they have been done with care, and will assume that the error calculations have been done correctly. Hence calculations will normally be omitted from a research report unless there is something interesting or unusual to which the author wishes to draw attention. On the other hand, your demonstrator has to mark your report and will want to both see the raw data and to know how you did the calculations. He will also want a readable report \u2013 not one that is broken up by slabs of arithmetic. How you handle this problem will depend on the experiment and the nature of your calculations, but unless the calculations are very short, they should be put in an appendix. Every table should have a \u2018table\u2019 number, and every graph, diagram or photograph should be given a \u2018figure\u2019 number, together with a short title or description. (If a reader has read the abstract and introduction, but is still not sure whether he/she wants to read the complete report, the next step will be to glance at the graphs and diagrams. If they have no titles, they will be meaningless.) Every reference to a table or figure in the text should be through the appropriate number. Conclusion \u00b6 This summarises briefly what has been achieved and gives numerical results. It may include recommendations for relevant new experiments or alterations to the present one. References \u00b6 These should be given in detail, i.e., author, title of book or journal, page and chapter or volume number, year of publication, publisher and place of publication of a book. It is important that references are identified at the relevant point in the text. It is not sufficient to quote the book in the list of references at the end of the report without stating explicitly where it has been used. It is also important the references be accurately cited, and for a full description of citation style, refer to the style guide for Physical Review . General comments \u00b6 Finally, some general comments: * Organise your report before you start writing it. Jot down the above headings on a scrap sheet of paper and list under each heading the topics that you need to discuss or describe. Decide on the best order for the topics under each heading. Decide which items are best relegated to appendices. Your aim is to have a smooth flow of ideas and concepts from the introduction to the conclusion. Anything that breaks that flow should probably be merely mentioned in the text and relegated to an appendix. * Be brief. Having decided what you want to say, say it clearly and concisely. Long waffly sentences and paragraphs mean your report won\u2019t be read. A research report will normally assume that readers are competent physicists, and if the paper is in a specialised field, then the readers will already be competent in that field. In your case, we ask that you assume your report will be read by fellow students with a similar background to your own. It is up to you to explain what you did in terms that will be understood by your peers. Additional resources \u00b6 The article Scientific Writing Made Easy: A Step-by-Step Guide to Undergraduate Writing in the Biological Sciences which appeared in the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America is a useful resource, albeit in the context of biological sciences. It can be accessed directly from the publisher, or downloaded here Popular-science pitch \u00b6 Scientific communication is difficult, and perhaps increasingly so with incessant demand for ever-smaller chunks of communicable content. However, the worst reaction to this would be to \"pull the pin\" and say that it can't be done. There are excellent examples of people/teams of people who create and curate highly complex and nuanced content in broadly understandable ways, and increasingly this is a viable pathway for education. It should therefore come as no surprise that this is something that you should practice! You will select one experiment, and produce a popular-science pitch . This is not a pitch in the sense of stating what you want to do, but rather a pitch to others for why they should care about your work. Consequently, the content might be an interesting result from part of the work, an interesting aspect of the apparatus, or simply the context of the work, it is totally up to you. The task is deliberately broad, but the pitch should satisfy the following criteria: * less than one page * suitable to be distributed to a non-scientist Example pitch \u00b6 Below one can find an example of a popular science pitch for an extremely esoteric experiment: Pound\u2013Rebka experiment . By design, this is a rigorous, technical experiment which has had the detailed barnacles stripped off, leaving just the bare physics concepts to be communicated. Example pitch Moreover, countless examples of popular-science abound, from dedicated science platforms to news websites to social media, and content runs the gamut from glorious to drivel - and vaguely correlated with the listed sources. For near-guaranteed quality content, try Scientific American . Presentations \u00b6 On of the most important - and often overlooked - skills in science is the ability to communicate complex results and ideas succinctly. It is therefore of critical importance that this skill is developed and practiced. Presentation resources coming soon G. L.

Values will normally be presented in the form b \\pm \\Delta b . The reader of the report will know that they can expect the true value of the quantity to be within \\Delta b of b with some high degree of probability. In physics it is common to refer to the uncertainties as the errors , and the value of \\Delta b as the errorbar (named for the way the quantity appears on a graph), but this does not imply that the experimenter made a blunder or mistake! Every experiment carries errors with it and no quantity can be measured perfectly. The goals of experimental physics are to minimise errors as much as possible, and to understand the circumstances that produce the remaining errors. By convention, the values of \\Delta b are referred to the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution because this allows them to be easily manipulated and combined according to the rules below. Under this convention, the uncertainty estimate \\Delta b is often referred to by the Greek letter \\sigma (sigma). Because of the shape of the normal distribution, the true value of b is only expected to fall within the range b \\pm \\sigma about 68\\% of the time. b will be found within 2 \\sigma of the true value about 95\\% of the time, and within 3 \\sigma over 99.7\\% of the time (keep in mind that real errors are rarely perfectly normally distributed, and real results seem to fall more than 3 \\sigma away from their expectation values with discouragingly high frequency).

The random component can be reduced by repeat measurements, but the systematic component cannot-- so note that if the systematic component is large it is futile to attempt to reduce the total uncertainty by repeating the measurements multiple times. In order to find the random component of the uncertainty in a measurement, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the sample, s . The quantity s represents the degree of scatter in the data, and if the uncertainties are truly random then s should be normally distributed. The relationship between the error in a single measurement and the error in the mean of N independent measurements is simply given by \\Delta \\bar{b} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} .

This is unfortunate, as in practice, logbooks are a cornerstone of rigorous and efficient work. The realisation that this is the case typically comes after some extended period of working on a complex project, where it is simply too difficult to recall minor technical details or re-tread a train of thought, which leaves you wondering \"what on Earth was I thinking/doing?\".

As much as you are writing to convince someone reading the log, you can use it to reason with yourself, in a way which allows the document to act as a conduit to place you back into your state of mind at the time of writing. It can often be difficult to appreciate the need for such diligent record keeping in the abstract, but this will have to be a leap of faith.

In the specific case of an experimental log for a single project, you will have some materials to point you in the direction of what you are to investigate. From here, you can write something along the lines of a background section. This would contain a broad summary what you expect that you are going to do. What might be the aim of the experiment, and what are the relevant phenomenon. It should be emphasised that we are trying to move away from right and wrong, and rather discuss things that might be important. For example, if one is going to be performing an experiment involving diffraction, it may be worthwhile to explain what underpins the phenomenon: what exactly is the origin of diffraction? What are the implications of diffraction occurring, and how might these manifest in the experiment. The scope and explicit content to cover will be dependent on the experiment, but you want to provide yourself and the reader a comprehensive discussion of the phenomenon under investigation. With the (back)ground work laid, one basically enters the real-time cycle of writing a scientific method stream of consciousness: What do I want to do? Why do I want to do it? How am I going to do it? Why am I going to do it that way? What did I see? Why did I see it? What are the implications of seeing it? Once again, the exact flavour of this will depend on the task at hand, but basically you want to be explaining what you are doing and critically, why you are doing it. The markers of a successful log often take the form: I want to do this, and this is what I would expect I see this thing completely at odds to that which I would expect. I wonder why that might be I just had an idea, I am going to test it by doing _____ Okay, the results from that make sense, I know what is going on (proceeds to explain what is going on and implications) You may remark that this is just like the process one would follow for problem solving or troubleshooting, and you would be correct!

Mistakes are to be embraced: you can explain what was done wrong, or what was required to correct your understanding. To emphasise: to purpose of this document is to document both what you did, but also what you learned. The presentation of a log is not the most important thing, but it should not be overlooked. It should be well laid out, easy to read, and the thread of the experimental journey should be easily followed. It is simply not possible to construct on scientific report style log, as a formal report has clearly defined sections, whereas a log exists in the moment, but the log should contain essentially all of the information that would be present in a formal report. One of the purposes of a log is to provide a vehicle for the development of ideas, so if something strikes you, embrace it. Do you have an idea for something that could be done better? Write it down. Unsure of one particular aspect of a theory? Write it down. Can you think of a complementary way to measure the same or similar phenomenon? Write it down. Insightful comments and/or discussions which arise from a comprehensive understanding of a given topic and command over the relevant adjacent materials are the true currency of a log, and science more broadly.

From the marking point of view, there is no point in copying out a slab of theory verbatim from the experiment notes. In this case you should summarise the notes in your own words, in a manner that makes it clear that you understand the process. In any case, you should refer to this handbook, giving page numbers and equation numbers where relevant, and the major steps in the theory should be written up.

Each table and graph or diagram should have a table or figure number and brief caption describing it. Methods of analysis should be given but detailed calculations and measurements leading up to these results are not normally included in a scientific paper. It should go without saying that graphs must be clearly labelled with a legend, with clear distinction between data points and any theoretical or numerical curves or fits, and clear axis labels. Any information necessary to interpret the graph should be included in a brief caption. Error limits should be given for all numerical results and for all intermediate quantities which make a significant contribution to the accuracy of the final result. This is especially important in the abstract and the final conclusions. The error should always be quoted to the same power of ten as the result itself, and to the same significant figure, e.g. 1.67 \\times 10^{-19} \\pm 2 \\times 10^{-21} and (1.67 \\pm 0.0234) \\times 10^{-19} should be replaced by (1.67 \\pm 0.02) \\times 10^{-19} . Error bars should be attached to data points on graphs unless they are too small, in which case a comment should be attached to that effect. The method of calculation of errors should be indicated in the text. You should also discuss possible systematic errors, and if you can, possible ways of increasing the precision of the measurements. The goal of an experiment is to answer a question (e.g., is this theory true or false?). Without a clear discussion of the experimental uncertainties associated with a given numerical value, it is impossible to safely assign any credence to the value, or use it to answer the question. There is often a conflict between the way a scientist would lay out his/her report in a genuine research situation, and the requirements of a marker reading a student report in order to decide whether the student has understood the work and used appropriate experimental techniques, in order to attach a mark. If the scientist is demonstrating a relation between two variables, the result will be expressed in graphical form, or as an equation if it is possible to fit a relation. The reader will not be interested in the fine details of the calculation, but will assume that they have been done with care, and will assume that the error calculations have been done correctly. Hence calculations will normally be omitted from a research report unless there is something interesting or unusual to which the author wishes to draw attention. On the other hand, your demonstrator has to mark your report and will want to both see the raw data and to know how you did the calculations. He will also want a readable report \u2013 not one that is broken up by slabs of arithmetic.

Or perhaps you are trying to work collaboratively with someone else, or many other people on complex projects which have many constituent parts - as is common in software development - and you are having difficulty knowing which files have been changed, and which parts of the file have been changed. Enter: version control. Introduction \u00b6 The undertaking of complex projects has always demanded that one fastidiously keep track of progress, and the growth of collaborative projects which are increasingly undertaken non-locally, that is, they are not undertaken at the same place or on the same device, has seen the development of excellent ways of not only tracking progress, but also distributing the progress of one member of a team to all other members of the team. The most common way to accomplish this is by using distributed version control , which essentially boils down to all files which within a project - including the history of all files - being mirrored on any device which is used to contribute to the project. Beyond this, there are clever means and standard protocols to ensure problems such as conflicting changes to files arising from simultaneous editing are handled and don't break the whole system. These methods of working are standard across all industries and once you start using them, you will see why. Git \u00b6 Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are quite a few options for distributed version control, but the largest by far is the free and open source software git . git versus GitHub You may have heard of one or both of git or GitHub , and it is important to know that these are distinct entities! We shall flesh out their relationship below, but do not make the mistake of thinking they are the same thing! git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history Github is a hosting service for git repositories In a crude sense, git is the tool whilst GitHub is the service for projects that use git. We begin by looking at using git, and then will move on to how to use GitHub. This resource is really a how to get started page, not a full how to use guide, but following one of those - for example, the git documentation or GitHub training manual - will teach you all that you could ever want to know. Getting started \u00b6 Suppose that you have a directory containing content for a project: this could be a simple text document, a complex website (like this one!), or a lab lobgook and associated data, and we want to have some version control over the project. To do this, we are going to use git, and specifically the git command line. If you are using a lab machine, git will be installed; however, if you are using your own machine, git can be downloaded from here . When you first run download and run git, it is important to set some global parameters, as these will be used for all git actions. It is worth noting that this only needs to be done once on your initial setup, or again whenever you use a new machine. Begin by setting your name and email via: Set your identity git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com and you can check this worked by executing the command Verify your identity git config user.name which in this case should return John Doe . With our git setup, we can now look to creating a repository . You will need to begin by navigating to the directory containing your project, e.g. Navigating to the project directory cd C:/path/to/directoy and then the repository can be initialised using Initialise a directory git init which will create a new directory .git to store all the version control information. With the presumption that there is content in the directory, we can go ahead and add all files in the directory via Add all contents of the directory git add . which now means that any changes to these files will be included in our version control. Importantly, we must now commit these changes (that is, adding the files) which can be done using the commit command Perform initial commit git commit -m \"Initial commit\" Finally, we are going to change the branch to main , which as the name suggests is the main branch of our repository: Change the branch git branch -M main Whilst this all may seem like voodoo if you are unfamiliar with version control, it will hopefully become clear through the usage. As a blunt instrument, the above commands of git add . git commit -m \"Comment to describe changes\" can be used to update the entire directory, which after following the initial setup is often the desired outcome. To try and elucidate the status of files during the editing process, shown below is an illustration of the lifecycle of the status of files in the repository: and should you wish to ever verify the status of files in the repository, you can execute git status GitHub \u00b6 In the section above, we have created a local git repository for our work ( ) but often, this is insufficient as we may want others to access the content. This is where services like GitHub come in, as they allow us to store our git repositories online. In order to use GitHub, you will need to create an account . From here, there are a few ways to proceed, but we are going to continue with what is conceptually the simplest: 1. We are going to make a repository on GitHub 2. We are going to push our existing local repository to GitHub Creating a remote repository \u00b6 Creating repositories is a simple process, with the most difficult bit being providing a useful name and useful file structure. For example, in the context of labs, do you want a repository for each experiment, or one repository for all experiments? These are decisions that you will have to make - and live with - but once you have the idea of what you want to do, you can select New and then follow the instructions or the animation below: Creating a repository on GitHub You now have an (empty) online repository. Adding a remote repository \u00b6 The final step to hosting your content on GitHub is to push your local content. To do this, you must first tell git where to push the content: Add an existing remote repository git remote add origin <URL> and then execute the push Push content to remote repository git push -u origin master And that's it!

With the presumption that there is content in the directory, we can go ahead and add all files in the directory via Add all contents of the directory git add . which now means that any changes to these files will be included in our version control. Importantly, we must now commit these changes (that is, adding the files) which can be done using the commit command Perform initial commit git commit -m \"Initial commit\" Finally, we are going to change the branch to main , which as the name suggests is the main branch of our repository: Change the branch git branch -M main Whilst this all may seem like voodoo if you are unfamiliar with version control, it will hopefully become clear through the usage. As a blunt instrument, the above commands of git add . git commit -m \"Comment to describe changes\" can be used to update the entire directory, which after following the initial setup is often the desired outcome. To try and elucidate the status of files during the editing process, shown below is an illustration of the lifecycle of the status of files in the repository: and should you wish to ever verify the status of files in the repository, you can execute git status","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"reference/git/#github","text":"In the section above, we have created a local git repository for our work ( ) but often, this is insufficient as we may want others to access the content.

Another advantage to many in the sciences is that when one is using Jupyter notebooks to program in python , one can use markdown to embed formatted text in the notebook, making the code eminently readable. Indeed, it is for this reason that experimental logbooks are required to be prepared using markdown . Provided below are some tips and tricks for preparing markdown content, but there are countless excellent resources 2 on the web for learning markdown, so you are encourage to look around. How do I markdown? \u00b6 Writing markdown is not particularly difficult once one knows the tricks of the trade. Perhaps the biggest step one must take is recognising that difference between a text editor and a program for rendering text. A text editor is simple, for example, Notepad for Windows is a very simple text editor with no frills and allows one to simply write text, and importantly also code. The difference between text and code is that text is designed to be digested by humans, whereas code is to be digested by an interpreter (in essence, the computer). However, in practice when it comes to actually reading and digesting text, the display of text editors is typically visually unappealing and often difficult to read. One solution is to create a text editor which renders text into a better format in real time, such as Microsoft Word, but as anyone who has spent any time with Word, it has limitations when it comes to usability and formatting. In the world of science, especially when it comes to publishing, it is much more convenient to use tools such as markdown or \\LaTeX which allow the user to write pseudo-code, where content is written in an editor, and then compiled prior to consumption, where the compiler renders the text, images, and other objects (e.g. code, tables, etc.) to make everything look pretty. The answer to the question \"how do I markdown\" is thus write pseudo code in an editor of your choice and then compile it. Which editor should you use? Well, free and open-source editors exist online and these can be great for getting a start, or you can write markdown in Jupyter as described elsewhere. This page \u00b6 This page has a sole purpose: to serve as a reference page for common markdown functions. Markdown cheat sheet \u00b6 The cheat sheet is best viewed on this site, as it shows both the markdown code and rendered outcome, but you can also access the raw markdown or pure rendered form of this cheat sheet on GitHub, or access a Jupyter notebook of the markdown to experiment yourself.

Using `$$` will make an equation block: $$ E=mc^2 $$ E=mc^2 will render an inline equation. Using $$ will make an equation block: E=mc^2 Sub- and superscripts \u00b6 If we want superscripts and subscripts, we can use ^ and _ whilst in math mode, that is, in a $ environment. Superscripts and subscripts Subscripts and superscripts are created using $x_2, x^2$. If there are multiple characters in a subscript or superscript, curly braces must be used. For example, compare $$ x^(7t-3)_(a,b,c) $$ to $$ x^{7t-3}_{a,b,c} $$ Subscripts and superscripts are created using x_2, x^2 . If there are multiple characters in a subscript or superscript, curly braces must be used. For example, compare x^(7t-3)_(a,b,c) to x^{7t-3}_{a,b,c} Multiline equations \u00b6 Sometimes it is necessary to format mathematical expressions over multiple lines, and formatting in these situations should be done using the align environment.

Consequently, in addition to the safety content that is centrally managed by the university there are physics-specific safety concerns which are addressed here. Responsibility \u00b6 Safety is not the responsibility of a single person or group, but rather it is a responsibility which belongs to everyone. It is the responsibility of each person to be aware of the risks posed by a given activity, be cognisant of the methods for the mitigation of said risks, and know what should be done in the event of an accident. Moreover, we seek to create a positive culture of safety: this does not mean avoiding activities that pose danger, on the contrary, it is about ensuring we can perform the tasks and activities which enrich the study of the natural world whilst minimising the chance of a bad outcome. Duty of care A duty of care is the responsibility that all of us have to ensure that we, and those around us are safe. Legally, the university has a duty of care to staff and students, but individually and as a society, we have a duty of care to one another: things would be a bit grim if we didn't look out for one another! To co-opt a well-known \"law\" 1 : [You] may not injure [another person] or, through inaction, allow a [person] to come to harm which captures the sentiment well: yours demonstrators have a duty of care towards you, as do your peers, and you have a duty of care to yourself, your fellow students, and your instructors. Understanding risks \u00b6 Risks come in a variety of shapes and forms and thus it is important to be aware of the hazards that exist. It is also important to have a sense of proportionality and pragmatism when it comes to navigating risk: some things are extremely dangerous, but pose little danger when properly managed (e.g. mains electricity), whereas things we judge to pose little threat can be responsible for serious harm (e.g. falling over) 2 . Related to this is our eminently poor ability to assess risk, which can lead to people avoiding swimming for fear of being attacked by a shark 3 , ignoring the fact that they are many orders of magnitude more likely to drown whilst swimming, and likely did think twice about driving to the beach, which is by far the most dangerous activity the one does regularly. The sole remedy for a lack of understanding of risk is education: learning what are the risk, and how are they managed. Promoting a culture of safety \u00b6 Practically, a positive safety culture centres around being aware of hazards, and willingness to openly discuss risk. If you are unsure about something, or not comfortable in a situation, the best case scenario is that you are comfortable to say \"I am uncomfortable with this\" It is not always an easy thing to say, but it is one of the most important ways in which the safety of individuals and groups can be guarded. The purpose of the content here is to convince you that beyond an arse-covering exercise, it is important that you have confidence in that which you do, in addition to providing tools to assess and navigate risk. If you see something that does not look right, please say something. If you are unsure what you should do if something goes wrong, please say something. Contrary to what one might think, we love it when people speak up, and everyone can hopefully learn something from the discussion that follows! Risks \u00b6 The university's prescribed risk management process is documented elsewhere and the physics facilities are governed by this framework. UTAS risk assessment procedure The formal procedure for risk assessment is carried out by the facilities manager and the unit coordinator. A risk assessment is carried out as specified by the relevant policy document ( Risk Management Procedure ) and must be endorsed by the relevant body depending on the level of risk. The risk assessments for each year can be accessed below: Part I labs Part II labs Part III labs Risk assessments are valid for a period of three years with the provision that the identified risks have not changed. In an effort to make the content less terse, less didactic, less abstract, and more useful, some of the safety concerns which are commonly encountered in physics laboratories are discussed in the following sections. Electrical \u00b6 The most common hazard in the lab is electricity, in the form of mains power, but also electrical components and equipment. Given the ubiquity and importance of electrical energy, we spend much time investigating how it generated, transported, and used. We also study how voltages and currents can be manipulated to perform all manner of tasks, notably for the purpose of computation and measurement which explicitly involves the construction of electrical circuits and the usage of test equipment. There is no situation where one would be intentionally exposed to electrical hazards, but you should ensure that you do not connect or power on systems without understanding what they are, or what they are doing. When working with electrical components or circuits, try to avoid unintentional touching or shorting of contacts; in our study of electronics, it is unlikely an individual component will pose severe danger to your safety, but component damage or failure can lead to bad outcomes, for example, very stinky labs! It should also be emphasised that conduction pathways other than wires (e.g. water) and electricity do not mix: so when working with both fluids and electric equipment, one should remain extremely vigilant. Chemical \u00b6 Chemical information Detailed information about chemicals, notably safety and handling information, is often presented in a MSDS . These can commonly be found online, but the university has access to a detailed database through its chemical inventory management software 4 , which is accessible to all staff and students through the login portal , using the details: Field Response Account unitas UserName EVERYONE Password everyone The use of chemical agents is not confined to chemistry, on the contrary, the study and use of chemicals is core to many areas physics. Consequently, chemicals are commonplace in labs, although for the most part will consist of common solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or acetone) but certain labs involve investigating the physical properties of more exotic substances. Any experiment which requires the use of hazardous compounds will detail the risks posed and the procedures to be followed for risk mitigation. In all cases, it is worthwhile following best-practice techniques for handling hazardous substances, namely not handling anything about which you do not know its composition or provenance, using appropriate protective equipment, and following the handling of any substance one should undertake a thorough washing of hands. Chemical hazards are labelled using pictograms governed under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals , abbreviated GHS which are shown below: Radiation \u00b6 Whilst the usage of radiation is not unique to physics, the study of its origins and properties is largely confined to physics. The two flavours of radiation which require special attention are coherent optical radiation (lasers) and nuclear radiation. Nuclear radiation \u00b6 Nuclear materials are widely seen as the boogie man of the material world, which is largely because they are poorly understood. It is important that the study of radiation and nuclear materials not be conflated with the genuine existential risk posed to humankind by nuclear weapons, and indeed, we want a world with the most radiation-literate people so these risks can be assessed in proportion. The sources that are commonplace in the lab are \"weak\" sources, in that they do not pose a direct safety concern when appropriately handled. Importantly, safe handling of radioactive materials requires one to know what is the material: do not handle unknown substances. It is also critical that when handling sources of either \\alpha or \\beta radiation that you do not have any open wounds, or facilitate entry of the material into your body by other means (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, or eye contact) as whilst these sources can be innocuous externally, they can cause serious problems internally. Radioactive materials are controlled substances, and as such they will be managed by your demonstrator, and only handle the radioactive sources when they are required, act reasonably to minimise exposure, and wash your hands thoroughly with nonabrasive soap immediately after handling the source. The presence of nuclear material is indicated using the trefoil symbol Lasers \u00b6 There is no single device more emblematic to the modern world than the laser, perhaps other than the transistor. In any case, they form the backbone of our communication network, lie on the forefront of medical treatment, and everything in-between. Because lasers have so many applications, they come in many flavours, but all share the same property: without the appropriate respect, they can cause serious injury. In most environments, the primary concern is the possibility of injury to the eye, although thermal injuries and internal (DNA) injuries are increasingly of concern with the development of ever more powerful systems. The systems one is likely to encounter pose minimal risk; however, one must never operate a laser whilst wearing anything reflective (e.g. jewellery, especially watches) and never look directly into the path of a laser beam. When aligning optics, beam paths should be contained and one should be aware of any stray reflections. Whilst it is not mandated that eye protection be worn all lasers, it is good practice to wear safety goggles at all times. Hazardous optical radiation is demarcated using the Laser radiation symbol. Information on laser classification can be found on Wikipedia . The three laws of robotics were introduced in 1942 by Isaac Asimov, and have served as a useful starting point for considering the ethics of artificial intelligence \u21a9 See the Australian institute of Health and Welfare for the leading cases of injury in Australia . Spoiler: it is falling, and by a long margin! \u21a9 Interestingly, the number of deaths resulting from sharks is roughly a third of the number of deaths caused by bovines as cited by the National Coronial Information System \u21a9 UTAS uses Chemwatch for chemical management \u21a9","title":"Safety in physics laboratories"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#safety-in-physics-laboratories","text":"One can attempt to disseminate best-practice safety procedures with broad brush strokes, but in many situations, including experimental work in the physical sciences, the risk and procedures are highly specialised and unique to the area or activity.

It is also important to have a sense of proportionality and pragmatism when it comes to navigating risk: some things are extremely dangerous, but pose little danger when properly managed (e.g. mains electricity), whereas things we judge to pose little threat can be responsible for serious harm (e.g. falling over) 2 . Related to this is our eminently poor ability to assess risk, which can lead to people avoiding swimming for fear of being attacked by a shark 3 , ignoring the fact that they are many orders of magnitude more likely to drown whilst swimming, and likely did think twice about driving to the beach, which is by far the most dangerous activity the one does regularly. The sole remedy for a lack of understanding of risk is education: learning what are the risk, and how are they managed.","title":"Understanding risks"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#promoting-a-culture-of-safety","text":"Practically, a positive safety culture centres around being aware of hazards, and willingness to openly discuss risk. If you are unsure about something, or not comfortable in a situation, the best case scenario is that you are comfortable to say \"I am uncomfortable with this\" It is not always an easy thing to say, but it is one of the most important ways in which the safety of individuals and groups can be guarded. The purpose of the content here is to convince you that beyond an arse-covering exercise, it is important that you have confidence in that which you do, in addition to providing tools to assess and navigate risk. If you see something that does not look right, please say something. If you are unsure what you should do if something goes wrong, please say something. Contrary to what one might think, we love it when people speak up, and everyone can hopefully learn something from the discussion that follows!","title":"Promoting a culture of safety"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#risks","text":"The university's prescribed risk management process is documented elsewhere and the physics facilities are governed by this framework. UTAS risk assessment procedure The formal procedure for risk assessment is carried out by the facilities manager and the unit coordinator. A risk assessment is carried out as specified by the relevant policy document ( Risk Management Procedure ) and must be endorsed by the relevant body depending on the level of risk. The risk assessments for each year can be accessed below: Part I labs Part II labs Part III labs Risk assessments are valid for a period of three years with the provision that the identified risks have not changed. In an effort to make the content less terse, less didactic, less abstract, and more useful, some of the safety concerns which are commonly encountered in physics laboratories are discussed in the following sections.","title":"Risks"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#electrical","text":"The most common hazard in the lab is electricity, in the form of mains power, but also electrical components and equipment. Given the ubiquity and importance of electrical energy, we spend much time investigating how it generated, transported, and used. We also study how voltages and currents can be manipulated to perform all manner of tasks, notably for the purpose of computation and measurement which explicitly involves the construction of electrical circuits and the usage of test equipment. There is no situation where one would be intentionally exposed to electrical hazards, but you should ensure that you do not connect or power on systems without understanding what they are, or what they are doing. When working with electrical components or circuits, try to avoid unintentional touching or shorting of contacts; in our study of electronics, it is unlikely an individual component will pose severe danger to your safety, but component damage or failure can lead to bad outcomes, for example, very stinky labs! It should also be emphasised that conduction pathways other than wires (e.g. water) and electricity do not mix: so when working with both fluids and electric equipment, one should remain extremely vigilant.","title":"Electrical"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#chemical","text":"Chemical information Detailed information about chemicals, notably safety and handling information, is often presented in a MSDS . These can commonly be found online, but the university has access to a detailed database through its chemical inventory management software 4 , which is accessible to all staff and students through the login portal , using the details: Field Response Account unitas UserName EVERYONE Password everyone The use of chemical agents is not confined to chemistry, on the contrary, the study and use of chemicals is core to many areas physics. Consequently, chemicals are commonplace in labs, although for the most part will consist of common solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or acetone) but certain labs involve investigating the physical properties of more exotic substances. Any experiment which requires the use of hazardous compounds will detail the risks posed and the procedures to be followed for risk mitigation. In all cases, it is worthwhile following best-practice techniques for handling hazardous substances, namely not handling anything about which you do not know its composition or provenance, using appropriate protective equipment, and following the handling of any substance one should undertake a thorough washing of hands. Chemical hazards are labelled using pictograms governed under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals , abbreviated GHS which are shown below:","title":"Chemical"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#radiation","text":"Whilst the usage of radiation is not unique to physics, the study of its origins and properties is largely confined to physics. The two flavours of radiation which require special attention are coherent optical radiation (lasers) and nuclear radiation.","title":"Radiation"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#nuclear-radiation","text":"Nuclear materials are widely seen as the boogie man of the material world, which is largely because they are poorly understood. It is important that the study of radiation and nuclear materials not be conflated with the genuine existential risk posed to humankind by nuclear weapons, and indeed, we want a world with the most radiation-literate people so these risks can be assessed in proportion. The sources that are commonplace in the lab are \"weak\" sources, in that they do not pose a direct safety concern when appropriately handled. Importantly, safe handling of radioactive materials requires one to know what is the material: do not handle unknown substances. It is also critical that when handling sources of either \\alpha or \\beta radiation that you do not have any open wounds, or facilitate entry of the material into your body by other means (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, or eye contact) as whilst these sources can be innocuous externally, they can cause serious problems internally. Radioactive materials are controlled substances, and as such they will be managed by your demonstrator, and only handle the radioactive sources when they are required, act reasonably to minimise exposure, and wash your hands thoroughly with nonabrasive soap immediately after handling the source. The presence of nuclear material is indicated using the trefoil symbol","title":"Nuclear radiation"},{"location":"safety/labsafety/#lasers","text":"There is no single device more emblematic to the modern world than the laser, perhaps other than the transistor. In any case, they form the backbone of our communication network, lie on the forefront of medical treatment, and everything in-between. Because lasers have so many applications, they come in many flavours, but all share the same property: without the appropriate respect, they can cause serious injury. In most environments, the primary concern is the possibility of injury to the eye, although thermal injuries and internal (DNA) injuries are increasingly of concern with the development of ever more powerful systems. The systems one is likely to encounter pose minimal risk; however, one must never operate a laser whilst wearing anything reflective (e.g. jewellery, especially watches) and never look directly into the path of a laser beam. When aligning optics, beam paths should be contained and one should be aware of any stray reflections. Whilst it is not mandated that eye protection be worn all lasers, it is good practice to wear safety goggles at all times. Hazardous optical radiation is demarcated using the Laser radiation symbol. Information on laser classification can be found on Wikipedia . The three laws of robotics were introduced in 1942 by Isaac Asimov, and have served as a useful starting point for considering the ethics of artificial intelligence \u21a9 See the Australian institute of Health and Welfare for the leading cases of injury in Australia .
