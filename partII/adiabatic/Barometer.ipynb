    "The benefits of using python are its versitiliy and broad applicability. At this point, we are measing the ambient pressure using a barometer, but the pressure is actively monitored as part of weather monitoring. The Bureau of Meterology (BoM) has a Hobart based weather station and publishes the measurements in real time, which we can collect and check that our result is consistent. To do this, we make use of the _requests_ library, which can collect the data from the BoM. We explicitly ask for the data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is routinely used to store web-based data. We can use the _requests.json()_ functionality to interpret the data, and with a bit of simple manipulation return the pressure as measured in Hobart!"
